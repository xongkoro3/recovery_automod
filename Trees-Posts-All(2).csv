My great-grandmother was one of the coolest people I have ever met in my life.  Back in the early 2000's I used to go over to her house all the time.  One day I brought my buddy, Joel, along for a quick visit.  Now, my grandmother didn't mind one bit if we smoked a joint during our visit.  Sometimes she would even partake herself (she definitely did this time).  Now, when Grandma was high she loved to talk about her past.  So, after a few hits Grandma began telling Joel about the invasion of France by the Germans in 1940.  At that time my grandma was 16, and living on a small farm about 30 miles south of Paris.  She then starting telling Joel about a young German soldier named Hans that she fancied.  She continued by describing her affair with Hans. Apparently ,they used to sneak off to a nearby orchard and as she put it ""fool around"". 

 Joel was amazed and asked, ""You slept with a Nazi?""
Grandma replied, ""Oh yes, many times dear. His pecker was even bigger than the colored boy my father hired to work the east field.""

Needless to say, I was horrified.  Joel was speechless.  After a moment, Joel reached over and took the joint from my grandmother and said, ""No more weed for Grandma.""

3n4qqx,smokeweedtilyoudie,2015-10-01 13:17:54,My interaction with a cop,"I live & work in San Francisco in the cannabis & tech industries. Yesterday I was walking around the block to take a little weed break when I noticed a wallet on the sidewalk. It especially caught my eye because it was rainy yesterday and this wallet was bone dry. As if it was just dropped or ditched.

I opened the wallet and there is an SF Police badge staring at me along with the SFPD identification of the presumed owner, a retired cop. In this wallet was clearly some important things. Lots of debit / credit cards, drivers license, medical info, the works. I was trying not to snoop but I needed to find out who this guy was if I was going to return it. In researching his belongings I stumbled upon his medical marijuana card. I was shocked!

I ended up getting ahold of the guy and I just now got back from meeting him. He was extremely appreciative and insisted on giving me reward money. I stopped him and gave him a coupon card for my business, stating that I couldn't help but notice he was a patient and that giving the money to my business is just as good as giving it to me. He took the card and said ""Bullshit, take the money. Go get nice and high on my dime."" What a guy!

There's just enough negativity out there, especially surrounding cops and cannabis users. I just wanted to share this moment two stoners had together and hopefully spread a little bit of unity. Thanks for reading.

3n4kbs,AdamCyclex,2015-10-01 12:34:25,Lost in the Sauce,"Hello follow stoners, I am a college student who has been smoking for about 4 years now. 

For me personally, I smoke because I find that it is the best way for me to unwind. After a rough day, nothing is better than coming home to a joint while tuning in to my favorite stream. I am sure everyone has their ideal situation when smoking and that is how it is supposed to be, but when doing this one thing needs to be kept in mind at all times. 

While smoking is something that I feel can relieve my stress, I have come to realize that smoking is also what causes my stress. Due to a busy schedule of a student juggling college classes as well as a job, the only time I find to comfortably smoke is at about 11:00pm, this is the time I can be alone and unwind. This lead to not being able to go to sleep until 3:00am as I want to stay up to enjoy my high and have to tend to the munchies of course. I could not wake up comfortably to go to classes, missing assignment due dates was becoming a regular habit and falling short in productivity at work followed naturally, and what made it worse is that the entire day I am thinking to myself, ""man, I just want to go home and smoke all these troubles away"", so then the cycle just repeats itself. Smoking is something that I love, but I would hate to know that it is something that I am losing control of my priorities over. 

For those stoners out there, especially the younger ones such as high school and college students like myself. Make sure what needs to be done is done before you go and smoke. Everyone would like to be that guy who gets all his work done while high, but sadly only a few of us have the neck to succeed doing that. Every time you put off something to smoke instead, it will slowly become second nature for you to repeat this choice. Smoking is something that we all here at r/trees enjoy, but everything is better in moderation, that way you look forward too it even more now that it becomes a reward. Get that project that is due tomorrow done, and smoke the day after. Go to bed early if you have to do something in the morning rather than saying, ""you will be able to wake up after you smoke"". Most importantly, don't get lost in the sauce.

It'd be different from writing fan mail or posting on social media because it would go straight to the inbox of the said app on their (or their assists') phone. It would be instant.

3n4ja9,mcooper88,2015-10-01 12:27:13,I almost got busted for smoking when I wasn't even smoking.,"So I was at my university's ceramics building last night at about midnight trying to make a pipe. I should mention that the corner of the room where people put their boxes of clay reeks of marijuana but I have nothing to do with that. About half an hour in I had made the bowl and was working on the stem when the lights suddenly turned off. I stumbled around trying to find the light switch but couldn't so I left out the back door. As I was walking around to the front of the building I noticed a cop car in the parking lot and I kind of freaked out because I had left parts of a pipe lying on the table. I walked back in to find two cops, a man and woman, sniffing around the room (I don't think they saw my pipe. That would have been awkward to explain)and the lights were back on. I asked if they turned the lights off and like a fucking idiot she said ""no, did you?"" The man got down to business and asked if I had been ""smokin dope"" and I could tell from his smug prick face that he knew without a doubt I was guilty. They asked me a few more questions and eventually she asked to see my school ID. I showed it to her and she read my ID number into her walkie talkie so I guess I'm on record now. They finally said I could go as they started rummaging through peoples' boxes so I went and smushed the pipe I'd been working on back into the hunk of clay so they wouldn't find anything and I got the fuck outta there."

I got arrested and was at a .04 from a few hard ciders and some arcade games. They brought in a DRE who was adamant I was on  weed at the time. I peed in a cup and a couple months later they found ""a marijuana metabolite"", no amounts of anything, just the presence of it, and I got dragged into court and charged with a DUII. I didn't want a self-righteous judge (we have one in my district, and I *know* I'd have gotten that one to try my case), so I agreed to Diversion. Now I have to perform felatio on my car to get it started, as well as until next August I can't drink (meh) or smoke (wtf...) and I'm in Oregon where it just became legal! fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu!

I want to prepare a bitchin' time for myself once I finally can smoke again. What can/should I do to get ready? Should I stock up on stuff, maybe throw some seeds in the dirt, get some new equipment? I've been a bong/bubbler guy for most of my toking days if that matters.

Separate note, ever since I got to college, the couple times I have smoked have made me extremely socially paranoid, questioning everything I say and do for normalcy and that maybe I'm just completely ignorant of my behavior.

I have been toking for almost a year now and have took 2 tolerance breaks thus far. 

After my last break - this is the longest I have gone thus far without taking a scheduled T- break. I work as a operations and marketing manager at a really fast paced corporate office and also work part time on my side business. 

Because of the nature of my career choice, I have to always be on my feet. Remembering multiple projects, emails, tasks, etc. 

I've noticed that my thinking process is actually **a lot** slower than when I used to not smoke at all. Could smoking be a cause of this? I smoke about 5g a week; always at the end of my day and never during work time. 

Don't get me wrong, I LOVE and believe in the powers of Cannabis - but I also don't think it's a super drug either. 

Has anyone experienced something similar? Does it get any better? Maybe I need to take another T-break. "

I no longer enjoy smoking weed due to anxiety and paranoia and basically being caught by my grandmother unintentionally. I found myself chasing the high and in turn have made some bad choices over the years, which has brung so much bad karma, negative energy and people in my life . I've made so many enemies back in college, which I could have made so many good relationships. I dampened my relationship with my grandmother before her passing, because I continued to smoke in the house and even grew weed in the house without her knowing. I'm stating all of this because it traces all the way back to trying to chase the high. Sometimes I wonder if I was ever supposed to smoke weed. I took up smoking freshman year of college to in my mind ""relax and explore"", but come to think about it I feel I did it to rebel against my past and to finally be ""cool"". Now, I feel very depressed and resentful about everything in my life up until now. Everywhere I go I feel I have a mark on my head because people are so rude to me without even knowing me. Another reason why i'm quitting is because i'm trying to get my head back on straight and bring some sense back into my life. I feel like so much shit is broken in my life right now and only thing good is that I have my college degree. Now, i'm not saying weed is bad for you because I once enjoyed the joys of it, but I as a person took it too far. Even though I don't want to quit I have to and I have a hard time coming to the fact that ""all good things must come to an end"". End of my story.    "

3n39rt,uninc4life2010,2015-10-01 06:24:46,Is this a normal edible experience?,"This was a few years ago, but the experience still stays with me vividly.  My friend's older sister and brother-in-law made us pot brownies for his birthday.  Quite a nice thing of them to do at the time.  Regardless, I've always been a lightweight, and the kind of person who only smokes on occasion.  It isn't uncommon for me to go several months without smoking.  Needless to say, I was aware at the time that edibles could produce very strong effects, and when I had heard that there were pot brownies available, I was a bit hesitant over whether or not I should eat any at all.  

Now, the brother-in-law brings down a pan of brownies and tells us not to give any to his younger son, you know, since they contain drugs.  I think that it is also important to note that they did not use canna butter to make the brownies, rather they mixed dried flower into the batter and baked them like normal.  I know this is the wrong way to do it, but I figured it is worth mentioning.  My friend and his girlfriend each eat a very large slice, like a 5th of the pan each.  I was then offered some, but I responded by saying that I'd rather not.  Unsurprisingly, I was pressured to take some and ""have a good time.""  So, I took a very small piece, something the size of the last joint on my thumb, maybe only a few cubic centimeters in size.  I was told that that the quantity I ate wouldn't have much at all of an effect, and that it was pretty much pointless to eat such a small amount.  But, knowing what I had read about edibles, I refused to eat anymore and stated that I just wasn't comfortable with the prospect of getting too high.

Fast forward about an hour.  I don't feel any effects, and at this point, I just assume that I didn't eat enough.  TBH, I don't think my friends were feeling much either, knowing how long edibles can take to kick in.  They ended up leaving to hang out with some other friends, and I went home since I was feeling a little tired.  After getting home, I talked to my brother and my mom, watched a few things on the computer, and went back into the kitchen to get some food before going to bed.  At this point, it probably had been 1.5-2 hours since I ate that very small piece of brownie, and I had honestly almost forgotten that I had done so.  I was definitely under the impression that I hadn't eaten enough and that wouldn't feel any effects, especially if I hadn't already.  I was wrong, very wrong.  Just as I was about to open the fridge, it hit me.  It was like one minute I was completely sober, and the next I was at a [4] or [5].  I had a bit of an ""oh shit"" reaction at that point.  What surprised me was that I just continued to get higher and higher.  I had a bit of difficulty judging the passage of time, but I would have to guess that 2-3 hours later, a full 4-5 hours after ingesting that very small piece of pot brownie, I was still getting higher.  The type of high was certainly different than any I had experienced smoking.  It's a little hard to explain, but it was not like one I'd ever experienced up to that point.  It wasn't until a good 6 hours after ingestion that I can honestly say that I started to return to normal. 

I had originally planned on going to bed shortly after getting home, but I ended up staying up until 6 or 7 AM since I felt too stoned to go to bed.  I remember thinking to myself that I was very very glad that I didn't listen to my friend, and that I only ate the small quantity that I did.  I didn't have a 'bad trip' type experience that some have had on edibles, but I would definitely say that the high I experienced was uncomfortably strong, and lasted far too long for my liking.  If I had eaten any more than I did, I certainly would have had a very bad time.  I just don't think that I could have handled anything stronger.  I don't have any way of knowing how much thc was in the small piece of brownie that I ate, but I do know that a ""dose"" is considered to be 10mg of thc, and supposedly produces mild effects.  I can only imagine how high my friends got, considering that they ate probably 10x the amount of brownies that I did.  I haven't eaten edibles since, but I certainly would like to if I have the chance to go into a recreational store in a legal state.  If I get that chance, I plan on eating either one or one half of a 10mg candy to compare its effects to what I experienced, as I have been told that 10mg is a good starting point.  Because of what I experienced, I just wouldn't want to consume edibles again without knowing exactly how much thc I was ingesting. 

Overall, the experience wasn't what I expected out of edibles, and I was very surprised at how long it took to kick in, the length of the experience, and how strong the effect was.  Is it common for someone to eat such a small amount and feel nothing for nearly 2 hours, then be very high for 8+ hours after?  "
3n398b,mistahmoore,2015-10-01 06:18:50,High altered by chemical pesticides?,"I was told a few years ago, when I had poorer contacts, that the weed in our local area is usually sprayed with lots of pesticides and chemicals, so when you smoke it, it's actually what a lot off the high is.

3n2c3f,gayd3n,2015-09-30 23:43:44,Discussion about poppers,"I live in Ontario, Canada, and poppers are a pretty big thing here. Recently I've heard that they actually were created in Ontario and most people in the US have never heard of them. Just wanna know if there's any validity to that or if someone's just too high.

For those who don't know; A popper is a mixture between a piece of a cigarette and weed. You need a metal bowl piece+tube, screw off the bowl piece, cut off the end of a cigarette and shove it in, then stamp your weed on top of the cigarette. They're called poppers because when the tib (cigarette part) falls through it makes a popping noise. Popular because nice headrush from the tib and you get equally, if not more, high using less weed. It's also a completely different (better) high. Downside is: addicting as hell because of the tobacco and absolutely AWFUL for your lungs."

3n2bmy,kidd_instynct,2015-09-30 23:39:03,Hookah vs bong [7],"Hookahs are fucking awesome. They're ornate, but more importantly they're social. You set a couple coals on top of the bowl and you and your friends all take draws for a couple hours. Its more ergonomic than a bong, you can take draws while making eye contact with people, and its essentially flavored smoke on tap. Bongs have none of this. The problem is, mixing weed with shisha doesn't work too well in my experience. So what are the design limitations stopping a hookah style water pipe for weed from happening?
Tl;Dr why don't we have weed hookahs"
3n2b3r,somewhatadequate,2015-09-30 23:34:12,How a controlled buy goes down,"I know how these work and I hate seeing people get in trouble for something that shouldn't be a crime anyway. 

This probably won't be relevant for a lot of you because vice units don't typically go after somebody only dealing in marijuana. They will, however, go after somebody dealing marijuana if they know that person has access to harder drugs in hopes that they can get them to flip. So if you're one of those people, read up. 

First, somebody will get arrested, a member of the vice unit will then interrogate them and get them to flip on somebody. If you're dealing in less than a few pounds of marijuana you're safe. Nobody will know that person got arrested. The informant will meet with an ADA and sign some papers and a list of ""targets"". This list can be changed. 

Then, the informant will meet the vice officer somewhere, usually a high traffic parking lot, and the informant will contact the dealer in the presence of the officer. The informant will call you and have a recorder in their ear, similar to an ear bud. They don't tap phones unless it's some high level shit. And if you're reading this you're not on that level. The informant will say how much they want and you name the price. Say however much you want, they'll take it. 

Next they'll go to meet you. They will usually have a recorder on them. It can be several different types but usually a black MP3 player looking thing. It's small enough that it can really be put anywhere. The entire time during the meet there is a team of officers parked all around, they can be in any vehicle, not just crown vics. Sometimes they're on foot, depends on the situation. They'll pay you and leave. The money is all photocopied, the serial numbers are all on record.  

Finally, the informant will meet his handling officer somewhere, turn over the drugs and the recorder, sign some papers, get paid and leave. 

And there it is, you're life just took a turn and you don't even know it. Do what you will with this knowledge, I thought you all should know. "

I smoked as a teenager and through my college years but gave that up for my family. A few weeks ago I was out of town and got in contact an old college buddy of mine. I ended up smoking pot for the first time in about 20 years and man, did I have a great time! When I returned I decided to figure out how to get a hold of some because I wanted to switch things up a bit in my life. I managed to buy 1/8 of some pretty good marijuana (or maybe it's junk and my tolerance is low!). It was very moist, pungent and smelled like fresh blueberries (I was told it is blueberry kush). A few days ago I noticed it was pretty dry and crumbling when I tried to clump it together to put in my pipe. I went to the ever-trusty google and I found some people suggesting to put a damp cotton swap, lettuce, fruit....basically anything with some moisture in the container for a few hours to return the moisture. I found a big sugar-shaker (like they have at breakfast joints....no pun intended!) and put my remaining pot inside, wet a napkin and put the shaker's top back on. In the morning I checked on it and my pot sure was moist, but it smelled entirely different! It didn't have the same strong pungent marijuana smell; it almost smells like tea. Is this something to be concerned about? I read about the possibility of a mold. The last thing I want to do is smoke some pot that might make me sick. Has this ever happened to any of you?"

3n1urn,9Solid,2015-09-30 21:21:39,Smoking on the Biggest Drinking Night of the Year.,"The night before Thanksgiving is considered the biggest drinking night of the year, with people coming home for the holidays, the hangover cure that is Thanksgiving dinner and everyone getting off. A few years ago I experienced this firsthand.

I was a Freshman in college and although I commuted all four years, many of my friends were home for their first time since going away and were excited to be back in the neighborhood.

I was shooting the shit with my brother and another friend Nick who had just came over from a bar. My brother pounded down 3 four lokos (hes a pretty big guy so he didnt die) and we were drinking while passing around a blunt. I get a call from another friend Joel who is a few blocks from me drinking with a few other people. I live in a wooded suburb, underage kids for the most part much get away with smoking and drinking as they please. I tell him Ill meet up with him soon and continue smoking. 

My brother finishes another four loko (thats now four if youre counting) and he and my friend go out back. While theyre outside, I get another call from Joel who now tells me our friend Jack drank too much and he could use my help in getting him home. I tell him Ill be there in 5 to help and at that moment I hear gaging. My brother is heaving into the grass outside. I make it 15 and help my brother alone (Nick had left before my brother started puking.) I got my brother on a couch, sitting upright with a large, orange painters bucket on his lap. Perfect!

I walk a few blocks to get to Joel and Jack and Jack looks extremely pale. We get him to a nearby convenience store parking lot and his mom arrives to come pick him up. She thanks us drives us back to my place before taking Jack home. Mind you, were only two minutes from my house, but about 30 seconds into this drive Jack just erupts vomit onto the dashboard. Jacks mom begins pulling over while rolling the window down. 

Throw up outside, Jack! Not in the car! NOT THE CAR!!! 

It was too late. Puke made it on the dashboard, window, door, seat, Jacks mom. EVERYTHING. 

The door opens and Jack spills out onto the side of the road while taking his shirt off and shouting for us to leave him. Joel and I, holding back laughter, watch in the backseat. His mom says that shes not going to leave him on the side of the road, and he gets back in the car and we proceed to drive back to my house, now with the windows down to get rid of the puke smell. 

Joel and I head to my basement where I fill him in on what happened before I came. My brother was snoring, bucket still comfortably on his lap. I notice theres half a blunt left, and offer to smoke it with Joel, who I know hasnt smoked in 9 or so months since he entered training. (He wanted to join the marines, but was sent home due to a flora allergy.)

He agrees and smokes with me and we joke around a bit. Joel, having not smoked in such a long time seems to be enjoying it before things begin to turn. He starts saying things like, This isnt me. And talking about his then girlfriend. (She wasnt anti weed per se, but had an addict relative.) I tried to relax him but he ended up calling his then girlfriend worried shed be mad. Yelling, Im so sorry! This isnt me. Im so high. Stuff like that. She laughs at him and isnt mad and tells him to relax. Things calm down. Joel says he needs to use the bathroom. Some time passed and I went to check on him and found him with his head in the toilet. Hey, I was happy someone finally made it in a toilet tonight. The night concluded with me showing him into my guestroom and I put a trashcan on the side of the bed just in case. 

The next morning I wake up at 9am and check on Joel. I walk into the guest room and hes on his feet with his jacket on. He thanks me and runs off. His parents are kind of strict, and he doesnt live too far, so I say goodbye. I look over at the trashcan, puke made it on the sheets and on the floor around the trashcan. It was pretty close so Ill give him credit.

Downstairs my mom is cleaning out the big orange pain bucket of my brothers puke. 

Did someone just leave? What happened last night? she asks.

Yep. Joel threw up upstairs. I said with a grin. 

Youre cleaning that up. Ill clean up my kid, but hes not mine. Thats your friend. 

I laugh as Im grabbing a scrub brush, Biggest drinking night of the year.

TL;DR Smoking instead of drinking involves a lot less vomit before Thanksgiving.

I am literally me thinking about me. Why the fuck am I me? How the fuck did I happen? Why the fuck do I even exist? I am literally a thinking sack of meat!!

3n1or5,Dem0nic_Jew,2015-09-30 20:36:08,'Twas the night before Dankmas,"When all through the house  
Not a burner was lighting, not even the dabber;  
The bowls were hidden in the chimney with care,  
In hopes that The Dealer soon would be there;  
The tokers were nestled all sober in their beds;  
While visions of nuggets grinded in their heads;  
And Grizzle with her 'keef, and I with my wrap,  
Had just sobered our brains from a short tolerance nap,  
When out on the street there arose such a light,  
I sprang from my bed to see what was, shiiiiit.*  
Away to the window I flew like a flash,*  
Pulled down the shutters and threw out the ash.  
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow,*  
Johnny got one last good whiff of blow  
When what to my red eyes did appear,  
But a miniature sedan and eight niggears,*  
With a big ass honky so lively and quick,  
I knew in a moment he must be Slick Nick.  
More fluid than concentrate his homies they came,  
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:  
""Now, Basher! now, Rancer! now Tanner and Vickson!  
GO, Thomas! GO, Rupert! GO, Conner and Trick Nickson!  
To the top of the porch! to the side of the wall!  
Now knock away! Knock away! knock away yall!""  
As wood that creaked under their feet,  
When they meet with an obstacle, they stomp with their feet;*  
So they ignored the doorbell the cursers they flew  
With the lucnhbox full of toys, and Slick Nick too*  
And then, in a moment, I heard at the door  
The sighing and patting of each little hood.  
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,*  
Through the door with a loud sound*  
 Slick Nick came with a bound.  
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,  
And his clothes were all hemmed with gold and dank;  
A lunchbox of joints he had flung by his sack,  
And he looked like a pimp just opening his pack.*  
His eyeshow they squinted! his smile, how merry!  
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!*  
His numb little mouth was sagged down like a hoe's,  
And the beard on his chin was white from the blow;  
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,  
And the smoke, it smelled of dank keef;  
He had a low brow and a big round belly*  
That burned when he laughed, like a bowl full of mary.*  
He was chubby and slick, a right jolly old kin,*  
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;  
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head  
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;*  
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,  
And filled all the bongs; then burned without a smirk,  
And laying his finger aside of his nose,  
And giving a nod, out the door, he rose;*  
He sprang to his hatchback, to his team gave a whistle,  
And away they all flew, the sprang out hoping to get away from the boys in blue.  
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight  
Happy Dankmas to all, and to all a good flight!

That to secure these strains, Governments must institute pro-marijuana laws among Men, deriving their just powers from the red eyes of the governed,  That whenever any Form of Government becomes too much of a square, it is the Right of the People to hotbox their building until they change their mind, or to institute new Government, laying its foundation on  such principles as the love for some MJ and organizing its growers in such form as to produce more of God's greatest gift. Stoners, indeed, will dictate that bong rips should not be restricted for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to sobriety, while unfair laws like this are sufferable than to get high by smoking out their congressmen and abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of MIPs and felonies fall on their shoulders, while pursuing invariably the freedom to smoke displays a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism of the DEA, it is their right, it is their duty, to break out a bong in public, and to provide new splash guards for their future seshes.

3n1bk2,NewOregonEnt,2015-09-30 18:59:20,First time smoker with the new Oregon laws going into effect tomorrow; Would love some tips/advice!,"I'll try to keep this as brief as possible.

I'm planning on trying smoking out for the first-ish time tomorrow as my local dispensary will start selling to the general public. I'm a new smoker however and would love some tips and advice. 

**My Background**:
Growing up I had a lot of stoner friends, though I never bothered trying it. I was never really agaisnt it, just never thought of it as my cup of tea. I eventually made some friends that were far less obssessed about pot and smoked much the same as casual social drinking and I warmed up to the idea of trying it much more. The only time I've truly been high is when we went as a group to see Cake in concert. I took about 2 bong rips and I felt it on the way to the outdoor amphitheater, however I think either the kind of pot I smoked or the fact that I took way too big of hits for my first time I had a very strange experience. My girlfriend has smoked in the past and from her expierence she knows she doesn't like sativa as it makes her very paranoid and prefers indica. So my plan was to get a bit of that strain and try it with her in the next couple days. 

**Experience from first time High**: At the concert I felt as if I had super ADHD, my attention span was on a 10 second timer and I kept going through these checklists in my head. Check my waterbottle, listen to the concert, check my friends rinse repeat. After an hour or so it started to mellow out and I just felt calm and happy. It was very strange and very scary to start with. I have no idea what kind of Strain it was or if it was simply the fact that it was too much for my firs time.


**Reason why I'm wanting to try smoking** : I don't plan by any means to become an every day smoker but thought it may end up as a fun experience to do every once in a while with my girlfriend or with some music/movies. I've only been drunk a couple times in my life but I've since learned that my alcohol tolerance is incredibly low. Even having a single beer the following day I feel totally off with a small mild hangover that persist through the day. No fun. Since then I've stopped drinking. I'm really interested in trying out everyday things and seeing how they differ from normal when high. Playing games with my friends, watching movies/tv and listening to music especially since I have some very nice high-quality headphones. 


**Advice or tips that I'd love** What was your first experience smoking? What would you recommend to someone who is trying it basically fresh. Should I smoke? Should I use a pipe or a bong? Should I try edibles? What strains would you recommend? Any and all advice would be awesome! I also plan on having the Dispensary clerks recommend things for a first time smoker as well.

I smoked heavily in my teenage years and I've done endless amounts of research for my children's sake.

Stop saying ""you can't get addicted to weed"" or ""you can't OD on weed"". You can become addicted to marijuana exactly like any other substance; and for those who didn't know, you can become dependent on pretty much anything, not just recreational substances. I've seen countless kids with bright futures get mixed up with small amounts of light drugs (marijuana) and I've seen it ruin multiple lives. It's nearly impossible to take a lethal dose of marijuana, but that fact drives teens to feel like what they're doing isn't harming their body when it reality, it's destroying them psychologically. 

I'm a full supporter of legalization, but if you're a parent to a child (under 18) and they are consuming medical cannabis for a condition, PLEASE MODERATE THEM YOURSELVES - a very high percentage of the time, these kids are too young to realize they need to moderate their usage. As I said, since the general idea of weed is that ""you can never smoke too much"", kids will get tempted to do more and more and now this drug-seeking behavior is excused because they have ""insomnia"".

It's got a bottom beaker with a downstem, a middle piece with a percolator and a shorty 4 inch mouth piece top. Also has an attachment for the bowl piece with an ash catcher and mini percolator in it. 

I put water in the middle just above the perc and bottom beaker just above the downstem. Also some water in the attachment. I put weed in the bowl piece and I light it.

HERES THE PROBLEM: When I rip a bowl, the smoke comes through the bong very slowly and it is extremely hard to pull and clear the bowl. On my previous bong, the bubbling sounded louder and stronger, on this it sounds weak and like a light fizzle almost. When trying to clear my bowl after pulling out the bowl piece, the smoke still barely rises and seems to not hit very hard.

Any thoughts on this ents? Thanks a ton.

To clarify, it sounds like air might be escaping from somewhere. But it's not. I've taken it apart and reduced it to just the beaker bottom and it still sounds wrong and pulls slowly. It's hard to pull. My old bongs bubbling sounding deeper, if that makes any sense."

Since the beginning of this summer I had some strange effects when smoking, I had a pain in my chest, I felt paranoid and couldn't enjoy the high. That was when I smoked alone.

Then I smoked with a friend and it was cool. We even went to amsterdam and we smoked a lot, playing pool and watching the prostitutes in the redlight district was a lot of fun. I had this weird pain in my chest sometimes but I just had not to think about it and it was gone. Then back to my country, my friend left to the country he is studying at. I haven't smoked since 2 weeks because I had absolutely no fun doing this.

I really miss the time I could spend whole nights smoking and playing video games. I want to try it again but I'm scared that a bad experience would disgust me from weed forever. What should i do ?"

I've always smoked over the summer and this was the first time that I've smoked at home. After leaving my friends and beginning my walk home, I realized that it was going to be the first time that I walked to my apartment high and was going to have to greet my doormen. I was super nervous about what to say to them.

I get to the door and it's my favorite guys, Tom and Dennis. I take off my headphones and greet them super chill. As I walk by, I'm so happy that I made it through all good. Suddenly, I saw a group of workers putting up a christmas tree in our lobby. One worker is sitting down while another is putting ornaments on the tree. The guy sitting down pulls out an ornament and hods it out as I walk by. I panic and *grabbed the ornament* then say ""thanks so much."" They stare at me silently for a second, and I knew I fucked up. 

""I was handing them to him, not distributing them!"" the guy said while laughing. Everyone stared and I walk away. My fight or flight instinct must have kicked in, because I have no memory of taking the elevator; I was just instantly in my apartment. I'm so embarrassed, I have to see those guys almost everyday. [5] 

TL;dr Came home high and had to greet doormen.  Guys were putting up a christmas tree and one held out an ornament to give to the other. I took it and said ""thank you so much!"""

I recently purchased a new bong and I've gotta be honest, it's as fucking stereotypical as bongs get. No lie, its literally [this](https://images.rapgenius.com/5a28a27fb9c1ff9f4e7e1b2d0f549ff6.965x1000x1.jpg) but with the colors reversed. But fuck it right? I fucking love how stupidly stereotypical it is, I love it for it's awesome colors, I think we're all entitled to at least one thing like that.

At any rate the unfortunate thing about this bong is that it seems to have been painted with some very cheap paint that is not water resistant. This means that each time I wash it the paint peels off in areas. At this point its getting kinda sad and the bong doesn't look as good as it used to. So fuck it, I figured why not repaint it my self as a fun activity and give the bong a fun memory tied to it.

So what I'm getting at here is, does anyone know of any good paints that can be used on glass and is waterproof which most importantly will not kill me through toxins or what not. I'll be honest, I'm not an artist so I haven't a clue about paint, I'm hoping some of the more artistic ents can help me out here!

I'll clean it out completely, and by the second or third bowl the hits are disgusting, almost impossible to hit. and this is WITH A CARBON FILTER. 

I'm thinking it might not be the bowl, but perhaps the mouthpiece on the wubbler? It has a bent neck and flared mouth piece which creates a kind of funnel of smoke of sorts.  Every time I hit the piece I always end up with a bunch of brown resin on my lips. Never happens with traditional bongs with straight tube mouth pieces. 

Here's the piece for those wondering: http://aqualabtechnologies.com/scientific-glass/manifest-glassworks/manifest-small-circ-perc-bubbler-platinum.html

 let me explain why; I did smoke weed recently and there are opiates in my system from the painkillers that i got prescribed for my hernia pain.
There is no way i can get the substances out of my system till tomorrow. It seems that is quite a struggle to get someone elses urine and use it as yours as well, really hard to find sober people. :)

Now guys I really need your help as i can't lose this job. There is no way i can order the magic drink online, as i have no money and anyway it would be impossible to get it delivered in 12 hours.
Is there any way i could mix some liquid and colorant to look like urine?
Is fine, as nobody will watch me peeing in the cup, they will ask me to empty my pockets and give me the cup to pee in it, probably. So i can hide a condom filled with liquid in my underwear.
Please come up with some ideas on how to pass the test.

thanks!

P.S. Is not that they won't understand that i had pain from my hernia repair and i really had to take painkillers, but is the law that says i cand have the job unless i'm perfectly clean. is stupid because i know a guy that works here and he takes painkillers on daily basis knowing that they wont get tested again. is just when you get the job, so they wont employ a junkie.

It was spring of 2014. My old connect just went to jail so I was in the market for a new one. A good friend of mine, we'll call him Bill, put me in touch with a young dude, maybe 16-18 years old, and went with me the first time to get an ounce off him. For the most part it was all good. Maybe a gram short. Not enough to complain about at this point but we did let the dude know that we were weighing the nugs out. 

Second time I meet up with Young Dude (we'll call him that for the sake of the story) and he gets in my car and has me drive to his guys house. Guy comes out and gives us the stuff and everything is good.

Third time is where shit goes down. Young Dude tells me to meet him somewhere. He's on foot. He gets in my car and directs me to a specific address. Tells me it is one of his connect's house, but his connect's mom is home. Says he will run in and grab it and come back out. I'm not feeling this, but I've done this kind of scenario with Bill, my friend who put me in touch with Young Dude, and figured ""I'm right outside the house so fuck it"". I hand over the about $600 and Young Dude goes into the house. 

After about 5 minutes I am antsy and text Young Dude. 

No answer.

A few more minutes go by and a few more inquisitive texts go unanswered so I call Young Dude.

Again, no answer.

Now I know something is up so I am sending aggressive texts to Young Dude and knocking on the door of the house he went into. 

Nobody answers my texts, calls, or pounding on the front door. 

Neighbors are starting to look at me. 

I text my friend Bill and tell him Young Dude ran off with my about $600 and isn't answering. Him and our friend Reggie start blowing up Young Dude's phone. 

Of course, no answer from Young Dude. 

I let Bill and Reggie know where I am and they say they are coming from about 20-25 minutes away.

I can't wait.

I get an idea.

I call 911 and tell them that I met up with someone to buy a guitar off them and they ran off with my cash. I tell them that a friend put me in touch with the seller and that I met the seller and gave them the money, but the seller went into a house and did not come out.

About 3-4 cop cars and a police SUV roll up to the house I am at. Tell them the same story I told dispatch. Cops are knocking on the front door, neighbors are watching, and cops are going around back to check the backyard. One neighbor mentions that the last family to live in the house moved out months ago and that a teenager goes in and out every so often, but doesn't live there. 

Bill and Reggie drive by and see me with all the cops and neighbors. Cops think that Young Dude went into the house, hopped the backyard fence, and just went home. They were right. I call Bill and find out Yound Dude's last name.

As soon as I say Young Dude's full name, first and last, one of the cops lights up and says he knows who Young Dude is. Apparently the cop knew him from a stolen dirt-bike in the past. Cop remembers where Young Dude lives and tells me to hop into the back of the police SUV because Young Dude lives only 2 blocks from where we were.

I get in the police SUV and all of the cop cars drive the 2 blocks to Young Dude's home. Cops tell me to stay in the SUV while they knock on Young Dude's front door. His parents answer. They are total white trash. Cops enter the home and I have no idea what is happening for about 5 minutes. The cop who stayed in the SUV with me tells me that they are at Young Dude's home quite often because their neighbors call the cops on their family a lot and Young Dude gets in a lot of trouble. Big surprise.

The cops eventually come out of the house with Young Dude and let me out of the SUV. Young Dude has a defeated, butthurt look on his face. The cops made him hand me my $600 back and apologize to me while his parents are profusely apologized in the background. Young Dude's dad told him to shake my hand and he offered, but I told him I don't shake hands with cowards or thieves while I smirked at Young Dude, clearly enjoying my victory and rubbing his nose in his defeat like a puppy who pissed the carpet. 

I get back in the cop SUV and the drive me back to my car. On the way back, they tell me that the parents already had $200 of my money when they went into the house, inferring that the entire family was in on the scheme. I got back to my car, thanked the police, then met up with Bill and Reggie to smoke a blunt they rolled. Then they went and got me 2 ounces of bomb ass nugs for way less than the almost $600 I was supposed to spend.

The End.

AMA if you want.

**TL;DR: Guy takes my $600, goes into a house and goes out the backyard without me seeing. I call the cops, who happened to know where the guy lived. Cops drive me to his house and get me my money back.**"

3v6aan,daydreamer3h,2015-12-02 12:31:15,Universes evolve too,"Microorganisms are amazing.
They work together in their tiny tasks and behavioural habits (evolutionary traits) just to stay alive.
The microorganisms' success helps their sybiotic creature partners to survive as well. These creatures depend on the survival of a tiny network of microorganisms in order for themselves to survive.
This allows them to gain an advantage against other creatures in an ecosystem and pass their traits on.
The ecosystem then has to itself survive in a macro scale in the timeline, and everytime it fails is when one failure in one compartment of the ecosystems causes the entire ecosystem to crumble, such as the microorganisms not helping the creature in its normal way, and consequently resetting the types and designs of creatures within the ecosystem.
A kind of ecosystem evolution, or ""survival of the fittest"".
This forces the ecosystem to have a good composition of creatures in order to survive and pass on.
What if, the Big Bang is one of many sequential resets of universe instability, whose survival is dependent on the ecosystems within it functioning extremely well and keeping the universe alive in a way we currently SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY and understanding for.
Every reset is caused by a ecosystem failing to function, resulting in its demise.
HOLY FUCK! It's evolution of universes!!!
Now imagine, what if there are more levels above that that we simply do not know yet? Something in the 4th dimension?
What about above that, in an even MORE macro scale?

When asked if I had any questions about the pills, I expressed that I was told these pills could be addicting and I was genuinely worried about putting something like that in my body, and asked about medical marijuana as an alternative.
Here is the word for word response I got:
""Miss, anti depressants have zero addicting qualities. It says here on your record you already smoke pot, and I'm sure that it's use is why your depression is getting worse. Try using something the FDA approves of instead of becoming a drug addict, which it sounds like you are.""

Even after I told her I was sober for MONTHS and smoking pot prevented a suicide attempt, she still told me that she requests that I stop smoking immediately and that medical marijuana is a lie.
Thought I'd share my experience. I mean, I live in Michigan where we already have medical marijuana established, but it was crazy to me to see someone accuse me of being a drug addict while trying to prescribe me pills.

I was using my friend's bong out in his garage last night, we were just chillin' and he ran into the house to grab something to drink.

Well, I was standing there in front of the open door looking up at the stars and I took a rip. I pulled bowl thing out to clear it, and just at that moment my friend jumped out and YELLED to startle me. This would have been really funny but I jumped out of my skin and dropped that little glass bowl thing and it SHATTERED.

He was really cool about it and I offered to get him a new one because I felt bad. But uh... I don't know how to find one because I don't know what it's called.

There's a really cool headshop here that would probably have the solution if it existed, but I'm kinda embarrassed to go in with no knowledge (I'm a girl, and I always find that my not knowing something always ends in me being treated like a total airhead or some sort of poser).

So yeah... what's this thing called/is it fixable? It's the bowl piece with the long stem that you pull out."

2. Does anyone know anything more about this random drug testing and suspision of vistsis of amsterdam in korea? "
3v52zc,Nickavick,2015-12-02 07:40:28,Weird moment last night smoking in a park,"OK so last night something weird happened to me and a friend while we were smoking. Just to clarify, weed is illegal where I am from but they are trying to change the law so that you can smoke it in private places and can transport it in the streets. 

We live near each other, like 10 minutes walking, and there is this small park near our houses that we usually go to too smoke. We get there and I start to roll a joint with all that we have which is around half a gram. Everything was going like always, smoking, talking about last week, what we were going to do that weekend and whatever. 

So after smoking the whole thing we stayed there for a while when suddenly this man gets out of a car that has been parked there for like 20 minutes. He walks up to a house but doesn't ring or go in, he then turns around and starts walking to us. I don't know how my friend was but I was a [6]. Then out of nowhere the man comes up to us, starts talking casually and asks us if we have weed that he wants some before going to sleep so that he can rest easily. We say no but we didn't mention that we smoked and that we where high. He then stays there for a few seconds looking at us in this awkward situation and says good bye and leaves. After that he goes back to the car where he came out from, looks inside for some reason for a second, stands near it for a minute, then walks by it again and goes into the house that he was going into before. 

Me and my friend start talking about what just happened here and start coming up with theorys. He said that he was a drug addict since young and was desperate for some weed and had to go ask some random people that he thinks might have at 23:30 in the middle of a park. I said that he was just an old man looking to find a new way to relax from his OK life and release some tension by smoking a bit and had no idea how to get some, and probably saw us all the time in this park and knew that we always go here and smoke. 

After discussing for a while we couldn't come up with a answer to just what happened, and start leaving. We walk by the car that has been parked all this time and the guy inside asks if we have papers to roll with. I give him two just in case and then we leave. What I didn't realize in that moment was that that car has been parked there for like 40 minutes and just now the guy asks us for papers when there is no one else around. 

That's when we start to think deep and come up with another theory that these two guys where undercover cops. I told my friend that he was crazy and that the police wouldn't waste their time and money on just two random people smoking in a park bothering no one. But then he starts to say that it could be an investigation that has been going on for a long time and are following suspects that could lead them to a dealer and then to a narc, since I bought weed from another guy they followed me to this place and see what I do with it. After that I didn't know what to think and just went to my house to eat something and watch brojack horseman. 


TL;DR Smoked in a park with a friend, random guy asks us if we have weed, another guy near us waiting 40 minutes asks us for papers, think that they were undercover cops.

Just wanted to know if anyone had any ideas to perfect my recipe before I execute it tomorrow ;) I did NOT make amounts/times exact, only rough, because they change on a lot of factors. Just consider the process.

1) Crush up AVB into a powder using mortar and pestle.  

2) Allow coconut oil to sit inside a crockpot until melted, mix soy lecithin (as much soy lecithin as AVB you have) into it.  

3) Add a few drops of lemongrass oil.  

4) Slowly pour mixture into glass with powdered AVB, mixing as you pour.
  
5) Allow mixture to sit in slowcooker for a few hours, mixing semi-often, ideally not passing ~250F
  
6) Take mixture out of slowcooker, allow to cool, freeze for 8 hours.
  
7) Remove from freezer and place mixture in slowcooker and allow it to become a possibly viscous liquid once again.
  
8) Continue to mix, add some Soy Lecithin and lemongrass oil into mixture.
  
9) After some time, take out of slowcooker, use syringes to add into gelcaps, and freeze again.
  
10) ???
  
11) profit."

would you say i greened out or did i have food poisoning or something and it was just a coincidence i just smoked. its strange because i didn't smoke that much and i wouldn't know what its like because ive never greened out before.

3v4l14,jimmjimm6699,2015-12-02 04:30:55,I desperately need help and input on bad memory and marijuana smoking.,"First off I have OCD. This took me like five hours to write, so please respect it. Also I am constantly unsure of what I am thinking, saying/writing, and doing, and I am also unsure if I should have put ""so please respect it"" or not, so please forgive me for any randomness you might read. Ok, here's the main post: I have had a slight memory issue from before I started smoking daily(my memory got worse after I started smoking daily). I first smoked weed when I was 15, and I started a daily smoking routine (consisting of mostly smoking bud, but up until about a year ago it's been dabs and bud) at about 17, I'm 19 now and still smoke daily. My memory was just a little bit bad (it was enough to know for sure that I had a sub par memory. I wrote this to clear up any of you that might have thought that since I said a little bit, I might not even have bad memory in the first place) before I started smoking daily, now it's extremely bad. Today at work, where I do mechanic work on golf carts, I had the worst bad memory experience I've had to date. Here it is: when I'm working outside, there's this door I go through often to get tools or something, and I would normally (this is referring to the days that I smoked daily, that were before today, and it my memory had been getting gradually worse) forget what I came in for at a ratio of about five out of the ten times (I go through the door more than ten times a day, that's just the denominator I decided to use for my fractions/ratios). But now it hit an all time record, about seven or eight out of ten times. I would search, trying my hardest to imagine a simple image (to help trigger the memory to be reclaimed), like a snapshot of what I was just doing, but nothing, I find a completely blank canvas. I am asking you guys, if you SPECIFICALLY have had: bad memory prior to smoking and started smoked nearly everyday (as many stoners do), and whether or not you have some experiences like mine. Or if you have any other useful information that would also be appreciated, I am panicking and need the correct info (I THINK  it's what I need to know at least, could be wrong or I could need more info than the answer I want, that's just the idea I have in my head, I say this because I am unsure of things a lot, as I stated at the top of the post) as soon as I can, so that's why I stated the answer I would like.

3v4e5h,Delightfully,2015-12-02 03:09:10,An ode to indica,"Ever since I started smoking weed, I was always more attracted to smoking sativa's. I like the uplifting and energetic mood I get and I can get really creative and have a million thoughts running through my head. Now, I get that some people don't really have a choice in the weed they smoke, but even people I know from here (The Netherlands) either never try indica ""cause it sounds lame"" or don't even know that there's a difference in the two.

My boyfriend has been having bad times on weed lately. He gets really anxious and can get strings of bad thoughts. I heard something about that being a common sativa-issue, and decided to try out the indica I still had from a ""I do need to try this once"" kind of purchase with him. He had the BEST relaxing high and I felt so content and chill. Even though my mind was still very clear, I got a wave of relaxation over my limbs and felt really calm.

Monday, I got a wisdom tooth removed. Hurt like a bitch and got low-key painkillers (ibuprofen) that had all sorts of weird side-effects if taken in the dosages I was prescribed. I still had some indica left from the last sesh (don't worry dry sockets -people, I can do very elegant nose-hits with my MFLB) and holy shitballs! My pain is almost completely gone when I smoke it. Without weird side effects!

Basically, point of my topic was to say I really regret dismissing indica for so long and if you've been in a loop of sativa's and have access to different strains, give indica a go! I definitely recommend it!

If this is all new to you, give it some research! Or if you have the same issues my boyfriend had, maybe give the indica a go too if you feel ready. It might just open your eyes. 

**TL;DR Basically indica is the fucking shit**"

This thing held half a gram worth of smoke at a time. So we packed the damn thing and he filled it up with smoke. I hit it and instantly start coughing, most intensely flavored weed I've ever tasted. We each took 2 hits that amounted to a gram each. He then proceeded to tell me that we each just smoked a gram of green crack. Keep in mind we're dumb college students that don't get their hands on dank very often. The next thing I know, I'm across campus sitting in the chair in my room trying to hold onto reality as my brain does front flips inside of my head. He later told me that I geeked out and sprinted back to the dorm at full speed like a fucking cheetah."

      when ever they start smoking I abstain unless they specifically ask me if I want some. I usally turn down the first offer and if they offer again i usally go for it because who can say no to free drugs.

3v3oeb,Theaveragedude,2015-12-01 22:59:13,My mom thinks I'm high when I'm sober [0],"Okay rant time.
So this has gone on for a while. My mom hates weed. She didn't use to be as harsh on weed, until she started dating a hard-core conservative who believes weed ruins lives. Everytime I come home high, nothing happens...My mom will act normally and nothing out of the ordinary. However, about 80 percent of the time I come home sober, my mom questions me relentlessly as if I just killed someone. Today, I was in my room for a couple hours doing homework and applying for a 2nd job. When I come down to make food, she gets on my case. She said ""your eyes look red"" so I responded with ""I've been on my computer for a couple hours"" she disregards what I say and then begins preaching to me about how weed will ruin my dreams, she won't support me and it will cause me to lose all my focus...Funny, because I use weed to help me focus on a weekly basis. Listening to her misinformation for a solid 5 minutes irritated me, but I wasn't going to say she's misinformed or anything because I've tried that...it digs me into a deeper hole. It ended with her threatening to kick me out and not loan money for college. I really want to leave here, but I can't afford to move out to anywhere in my town since it's pretty fucking expensive. For now, I think I just need to be out of this house for as many hours as possible. Hopefully I get that 2nd job and won't have to be home as much.

3v3iqz,YesIAmLame,2015-12-01 22:13:19,What's the point of making some edibles so strong that they're labeled as multiple doses?,"I wanted to make some cookies so I did some research into different recipes, doses, and experiences, and it seems like 9/10 when someone gets far too baked to the point of nearly tripping balls and having a bad experience, it's a result of edibles. I understand there's a difference between not knowing what dose you took and underestimating the strength, but when a dispensary sells a single edible that is intended for multiple doses, that just doesn't make sense to me. I am in an illegal state and I don't have regular access to ""professionally produced"" edibles, so my information could be very distorted. I'm not claiming this as a fact, but merely an observation. 

The only times I've had edibles were from dispensaries from legal states, and they were very, very strong. If dispensaries have edibles specifically called [""rookie cookies""](http://gazette.com/colorado-marijuana-stores-roll-out-the-rookie-cookie-for-pot-newbies/article/1539157) to indicate lower potency, that seems to be a red flag that most others are incredibly strong.

I guess my real question is what's the point of making a single cookie, brownie, whatever... multiple doses? Isn't the point of an edible to eat it, kick back and enjoy? I realize that edibles exist not only for people who just want to chow down on a cookie, but also for those who can't smoke or don't want to. Regardless, there are other edibles out there aside from cookies.  Sure, you can share a brownie or cookie, but when you go to a bakery do you buy just 1 cookie and share it with 4 friends? I think the cost would be negligible, but like I said, I don't have a ton of experience, so this is just from reading what others have said (including you fellow ents on /r/tress!)."
3v3hct,throwaway123443233,2015-12-01 22:02:31,I'm pretty new to weed and I've realized that it makes me feel like a normal human?,"Hey guys, so I'm 19 and I've only smoked (correctly) a couple of times, but I've realized that even one-hitter amounts of marijuana make me such a better person. I would consider my baseline mood to be very depressive, and it's been this way for as long as I can remember. I'm a pretty terrible conversationalist; I am generally unsure of what to say and how to advance conversations so that they become meaningful. I think part of the problem is that I lack empathy, as much as I wish I didn't. I listen to music a lot but don't feel anything from it. Most movies and TV shows fail to hold my attention unless they're comedies (at no fault to them!). I would consider myself to be generally oblivious to metaphors and context clues and so on in media. Really I feel numb most of the time, and not in a good way :p. I seem to just be unable to well, feel much of any emotion? I'm not sure. 


However the couple of times I've smoked *correctly* (I figured out I need to get a 'pre-high,' which basically means taking a hit from a onie and then waiting until my heart rate drops down again before I continue (?) ) everything changes. I'm able to commit my full attention to whatever I'm doing. If I'm watching The Office I can just *notice* more, and I can put myself in the actor's shoes and realize the motives to everything they're doing and what every action does to progress the story. Whatever's happening elicits a genuine emotional response from me same with music too! It feels like I'm listening to it for the first time and I can actually, well, feel what I should be feeling. On top of that I actually CRAVE conversation with people - usually I shun it. I can think much more quickly too and really hold a conversation and enjoy it to boot. All this from sub-gram amounts of weed (don't really have a dealer so I gotta conserve it lol) 

Anyway, I've rambled on too much. It is just such a profound change in me. It actually makes me happy to live. Does anyone else feel this way?"

I am a very big conspiracy nut that has to do with the government and i love thinking deeply into these kinds of issues, so if you do not particularly enjoy these crazy conspiracies, this might not be for you.

Today I watched the culture high and got up to the point where it talked about all the wonderful benefits of the endocannabinoid system and how marijuana activates that system that ultimately helps the body function better and help the cells do what they are meant to do. 

This led me to think that if marijuana was legalized on a federal level and produced and sold directly over federal control, and since we do live in a country that cares much more for money than the health of our citizens (cigarettes, alcohol, Rx drugs, etc.) what would stop them from limiting the effects of marijuana in some sort of way so that it would not function in the way it was meant to? Sure, they would say that ""nothing beats it, it had the most medicinal value that no cartel or dealer can beat"", but ultimately we would be limiting the true potential of the medical benefits of marijuana. 

Wouldn't it be much more profitable for the government and private corporations to grow strains that only produced certain cannabinoids in order to treat certain illnesses/disorders/diseases/etc?

""Here you go Mr. Johnson, one strain for your back pain, another for your migraines, and another for your anxiety.""

More marijuana produced and sold = more money to stuff politicians and government officials pockets. 

Would this ultimately lead to the creation of new cartels that would cultivate the real, fully potent plant and sell it illegally? It's illegal to sell loose cigarettes, why wouldn't the government make it illegal to sell marijuana that isn't directly produced by them?

If you actually took the time to read this, I thank you. Please share your personal thoughts on this matter my fellow ents.

TLDR: Weed is legalized, the government turns it into a cash crop and ruins it. Food for thought. "

I was in a vehicle smoking weed in Iowa after driving two hours with a friend to meet up with some people. We were pulled over for speeding once we were with the people and after we had finished smoking. The fact that we were smoking was evident. They took all of our driver's licenses and had us step out and patted us down. One guy was arrested for possession because he said it was his and the rest of us were released and charged with nothing. To repeat we were not charged with anything. 

Exactly one week later the public safety official from our college campus approached my friend and told her that he knew about what had happened. He asked her to explain what happened she said we met up with some friends and then got pulled over. He asked if we smoked on campus she said no. She said that she thought it was illegal for him to even know about this and then he reassured her that he wasn't going to tell anyone. He then told her to tell me to be careful because they had a close eye on me and would know if I did anything. We go to a private school so if they have any proof or idea that we smoke we will be kicked out of school no questions asked.

3v2xch,Cybizerje,2015-12-01 19:35:45,"Not getting a typical ""high""","So I recently started smoking (its been a few weeks now) and so far I've been enjoying it, but I have an issue.  I don't seem to get a stereotypical high. When I smoke I have an experience very similar to that of being drunk, just without the lack of coordination or hangovers.  Sugary drinks taste great, things get funnier (only in social situations), and I have a great difficulty concentrating.  And that's about it.  I don't feel ""good"" like my friends describe (not like I feel bad, I just feel normal), I don't get the munchies, I just sort of zone out because its hard for me to concentrate enough to really do anything.  The one time I really did trip out was when I smoked waaaay too much, and ended up throwing up that night. Any thought or suggestions?"

I should have looked here before I listened to this terrible advice. I left an orange peel in a ziploc bag in a drawer with my stash for about a week. I don't smoke much so when I checked it a week later, there was some white web-like stuff on the outside of the buds. Not a ton, but it was visible. It is already gone after airing it out for about 3 minutes. Is it totally ruined? Can I salvage anything? Not everything appeared to be covered in mold. "
3v2p61,KillerMoth1106,2015-12-01 18:35:16,Can't tell if he is an undercover,"So I'm a bartender. That's the set up so I'm at work right now and this dude who looks halfway legit walks in. Pretty much immediately started talking about weed.. but hey some people are just not smart about that. Well he keeps talking and tells me he was here to sell weed (red flag). He then goes on to tell me how he got jacked some last night, and now he needs to get rid of what he has left before he gets on a plane or he will be broke and have to just leave it. He claims he grows weed in Cali. Well now I'm curious to see what he has to say, I've bartended for a million weirdos and I like to listen, anyways he goes on to say he came to my bar on purpose on the recommendation of a friend. One that I might even know ""Eric Smith"". Fishy as shit. So I claim yeah I think I know Eric, then he gives me the vaguest description ever, Eric the tall guy with a beard. I live in the fucking Midwest half the men in town fit that description. I just say yeah I know him, then he says ""yeah dude cool, Eric says hey"" 
      Now I'm really thinking fuck that I don't know any Eric Smith. Then he gave me his number, which is local not from California. Then he tells me he is meeting up with his dad and brother... which gets me thinking, why don't you leave your drugs with them? Finally he tells me he has to charge me a little bit, I ask about his prices and they are regional as shit. Like I'm not fucking stupid Cali prices and Hella north Midwest are nowhere near equal. He was even a bit spendy for around here. Lastly it's a quarter pound he is trying to push on me. What is the thoughts here?

Also this is happening live, I will call this bitch out if we all agree he is a pig"
3v2oly,420throwaway1111,2015-12-01 18:30:58,Enjoy It While You Can,"Hey fellow Ents, this is obviously a throwaway account, but I just want to say enjoy the herb while you can because you never know when it will be gone. I use to smoke nearly every day, those were some of the best days of my life just hanging with my friends toking up without a care in the world. Unfortunately, we all have to make sacrifices to get where we want to be in life. 

I've been away from home in a state where it is illegal for a few years, and even trying to procure some would be so risky that I would not want to endanger my future. Fortunately legalization is on the horizon, but it cannot come fast enough. Many states have legislation for recreational but I am disheartened to hear many smokers vote against it or will vote against it in the coming elections because of certain provisions in these bills allowing monopolies, not allowing growing for private use, etc. I just wish there was less of a political agenda (among smokers, politicians, and business men) and people were free to smoke without rebuke. I hope 2016 sees a new wave of states added to the legalization list, but I remain very pessimistic. 

Tl; Dr: Enjoy every day because you never know when you will be dry for a very, very long time.

3v2lkd,ffxthundercat,2015-12-01 18:08:54,APS Migraines Aurora and Trees,"I was diagnosed with anticaridolipin antibody syndrome about 2 years ago after having a DVT in my leg, its a condition that makes my blood extra sticky. I'm 23 y/o male and otherwise fit and healthy. This finally explained the debilitating migraines I have gotten all my life.

What will happen is all of a sudden I will notice that something in my field of vision is ""off"" and slowly over the course of 45-60min a small aurora will appear and grow until I lose about 70% of my field of vision on a bad migraine. Then it will subside after about 30 minutes of being blind-ish. Then a dull headache will persist for hours after. Been looking for the trigger for years but I have no clue. Had a migraine the last 4 days in a row, I actually woke up this morning with one in progress. Frequency has gone down alot with blood thinning meds but I still get fits where I get them day after day for no reason. Then go a month or so and have another burst of a few.

Aaaaaaannny way I don't really smoke weed much. Maybe 2-3 times a month, socially, and I've never actually bought weed for myself. But I think the application for my headaches might be worth a shot because once the auroras hit I'm basically non functional. I need to lie down, or stop driving, and just lay in a dark room and wait.

Anyone have any experience self medicating a migraine condition like this? Also what's better smoking or vaping for this application? Finally can you recommend a discrete vape pen or what ever that I can just walk my dog around the block do my thing cause my roommate situation is not accommodating to overt consumption.


Thanks!"

3v2ksa,throwaway12351512,2015-12-01 18:03:21,Defense Contractor Internship,"I have been recently told by someone who went to my school that his company which is a defense contractor would offer me an internship for the summer. He said I should receive the offer letter in a couple months. I haven't smoked in 2 weeks now in preparation for whenever the drug test may be.

I assume it's going to be a hair test so as long as it's more than 90 days from now I should be fine but I was wondering if anyone has had any experience with this and what exactly the time frame of when the drug test will happen. I also assume there is going to be a question of if I have smoked in the last 7 years and if I say yes to this, will the job offer no longer stand? 

Thanks in advance and I hope this helps anyone who is going through something similar in the future. "
