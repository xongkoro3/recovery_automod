So since the dawn of time there was a great bitch. The First Great Bitch. She was part of a race of dragons who practiced great bitchery. So picture the biggest cunt you've ever met and times that bitch by about 10 levels of cuntitude. She went by the name of Ms. O'Donnell, and in modern times hides behind the facade of a high school economics teacher. Ok, so now that bitch is out of the way, we must now allow you to experience the tour de force that is Mr. Getty. Nowadays he has limited himself to only taking on the form of one being, but that was not always the case. He was once everyone and everything. Literally every-fucking-thing. Just as Ms. O'Donnell, he works at the same fucking high school, but rather as a history teacher. He keeps a close eye on that bitch, keeping her cuntiness in check. The stage has been set: Since the beginning, these two behemoths have been going at it. Not in the way you're thinking you disgusting cuntbag. ANYWAY, these two monsters have absolutely fucked each other up and the entire world in the process. They have had many battles-coming close to killing each other many times. But Ms. O'Donnell is one crafty bitch and has evaded obliteration by Mr. Getty's fists every time. Not to say that she hasn't come close-very fucking close. ""I GOT YOU RIGHT WHERE I WANT YOU, YOU BLOODY FUCKING CUNT!"" Mr. Getty once exclaimed as he proceeded to facefuck the bitch dragon with his fists of doom. Yet again Ms. O'Donnell slipped through Getty's bodacious clutches. She flies away with her life, but not until after he punched her stupid ugly. Although they may have brutally fucked each other up into oblivion time and time again, they always escaped their epic confrontations alive. They may be rivals, but they always held an unspoken, reluctant respect for each other. And it is because of that respect that these two assholes may have spared each other from a lethal ass-pounding no one wanted. And so they live on, teaching today's youth a hallway away from each other. Getty keeping a keen eye on O'Donnell's cuntiness. Getty, biding his time, waiting for that bitch to slip up. O'Donnel, the mighty bitch dragon, sipping on her margaritas waiting for the day to level the playing field. And so we, and the world, hold on to our panties, anticipating..."

431xam,noved626,2016-01-27 23:30:19,Why Harry Potter should have carried an M1911 [Story] (x-post from /r/guns),"Found this while Googling Harry Potter stuff thought it was a good read

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/comments/gwl0v/why_harry_potter_should_have_carried_an_m1911/) by /u/Whind_Soull

""Ok, this has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know you're going to roll your eyes, but hear me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

Here's why:

Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.
Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.

Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.
And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you're going to say: ""But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!"" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?
Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.

Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.

I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:

""Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1.""

And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911."""

430vwt,Haydenthehunter,2016-01-27 19:19:17,Population Problem,Recently we have found that the exponential growth of the human population will eventually be met with a giant rock that can no longer meet our needs as a race. I suggest an idea in order to reduce the population. We hold a various amount of death related contests in which the winner would receive a substantial amount of money for winning. This would allow an opportunity for us to shave down the population of gamblers and unintelligible people. Russian Roulette could be held on Thursday. See Who Has the Faulty parachute could be on Tuesday. Which Bucket of Poisen Chicken contains the one per person antidote could be held on Saturdat. This would also create an opportunity for great television! There is no downside!

435mpn,justanner,2016-01-28 16:05:34,Mr. Getty and the Big Bitch,"      Mr. Getty is a motherfucking savage. The incomprehensible lunacy that is his origin is shrouded in mysterious LEGEND-that is-UNTIL NOW. In a time of tyrannical unbalance when Bitch Dragons were the superior cunts of the land, God himself punched the very concept of creativity right in its stupid head and embarked upon his ridiculous quest to bring about the existence of the perfect specimen. A mere mortal man whose ambitious yet uncontainable anger fell in line with Gods divine destiny; thus Mr. Getty was born and from day one the very molecules that constituted his being were infused with PURE RAGE. 
	Mr. Getty was so fucking pissed that after the first year the Bitch Dragon population was decimated by 50 goddamn percent. He then proceeded to hunt down Genghis Khan, who had instilled fear into so many millions of people, and proceeded to FUCK HIM UP; obliterating the very fibers that held together Khans resolve. Getty was NOT fucking around, viciously mutilating bitch dragons and Mongolian warlords left and right until there were very few left.
	The Bitch population was so fucked that the hilariously outmatched species was put into a headlock and viciously beaten in its ugly face again and again and again. Years passed and eventually a prophecy came forth. It stated that a newborn hatchling would stand up to the massive prick referred to by the name of Mr. Getty, absolutely annihilate his physical form, and then proceed to erase the concept of him by exploding the heads of those who had ever been exposed to him. And this Chosen One will be known as THE GREAT BITCH. 
	One day Mr. Getty was snapping a dragons neck when a new bitch that had never experienced the brutal beatings guided by the eternal inferno within him approached him. This bitch was bitchier than most, and gave off a bitch vibe. She even smelled bitchy. Getty quickly perceived her bitch levels and it only caused the fire within him to burn hotter than 10,000 suns- he was so FUCKING PISSED. Two fates were about to collide and/or FACEFUCK each other until they were pushing up daisies-burnt, crushed, and blood-soaked daisies. 
	Their battle raged on for fucking eons. Villages were engulfed in flames, peoples very essence were obliterated from all realms and planes of existence, entire oceans were evaporated. Their slugfest in the Pacific was so intense that it literally raised Australia from the depths and broke apart Pangaea (FUCK GEOGRAPHY, FUCK TIMELINES, AND FUCK YOU). This specific bitch had a neck that would NOT FUCKING BREAK and wings that were forged in iron. But she could not hold off Gettys astounding neck snapping abilities forever. 
	Getty mounted his foe and forcefully flew the cunt into the ocean. While in the water, Getty realized that this dragon is too massive a cunt for him and began to be beaten to the brink of death. Before the final blow was delivered, the man manufactured by FUCKING GOD felt a rush of boiling blood in the veins of his bodacious, neck-snapping biceps. He took the Bitch by her neck and thrashed her down under the waves, cracking her iron wings. While drowning, the beast prepared the anal punishment that no one asked for: she grabbed the Kraken by its BALLS and jammed that seemingly innocent motherfucking sea monster into Gettys UNSUSPECTING ASS.
      Getty screamed in agony as the Bitch went in dry. She flew up victorious and answered only one searing question: Wha-What kind of bitch are you? Getty struggled. I am ODonnell, you Divine Fucking Prick ODonnell said and soared upwards toward the sky leaving Getty alive to fight another day. The First Great Bitch and Mr. Getty will meet again and again in the many years that follow and the Kraken had to change his postal address: Mr. Gettys Ass Residence.
