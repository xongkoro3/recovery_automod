3lwk93,GettinDrunkWithJesus,9/22/2015 0:48:18,b'let the good times roll',"b'Let the good times roll...\n\nThe story has been written before and it will be written again. We want to do things that feel good. Is that a crime? I don\'t have the philosophy degree or patience to argue either side of that. I\'m just a victim of it. A victim of my own nature. A nature I, in the very least, share with others. \n\nWhether commiserating on a midnight run to the block or in the stuffy side-room of a church at least this condition brings the occasional good conversation. Mostly the former, but I occasionally catch some good stuff at NA meetings in whatever time is left between the the ridiculously repetitive readings. 12 steps. 12 traditions. Printed out and laminated by some poor old crackhead trying her hardest and passed around infinitely by the same hands that once handled ounces of meth, stolen guns, and strange cocks. Read in a voice that varies from the enthusiastic, i\'ve-found-god (and think you should too) voice, to the possibly illiterate drawn out recital that garners encouragement from the recovery bro\'s in front. It\'s surely made people more patient than me take 12 steps out the door and into their grave. It\'s all just so *supportive*. Can\'t fault anyone for that. Maybe Adam for not listening to God and pissing him off enough to create us and the things we enjoy to death. The rest is already written. \n\n""We DO recover"" and the reader scans the room with an eyebrow raised. It\'s gone from annoying to routine and back to annoying. In short, i\'m fucked by their definition of the word. \n\nI take a sip of my black coffee and try to relax. My leg shakes up and down. I\'m trying. Really trying. Doing everything I should be doing but... But what? There shouldn\'t be a but. BUT there is. Clawing at my stomach telling me to go. Telling me to leave. Telling me if this fuckhead would just shut up about his sickness of obsession with the girl who half-heartily serves his coffee I could MAYBE focus and have one of these spiritual realizations everyone keeps talking about. I thought I had one the other day. Two birds flew up to me and stared right at me while I sat down to eat a $3 pre-made sandwich from Safeway. I thought maybe it was them. The gone. Re-incarnated to tell me everything was ok. That I would be OK and I am protected. I opened my Sandwich and realized they had, characteristically, forgotten to include the tiny Mayonnaise packet that makes it edible, leaving me with a bone dry pile of garbage. How easily my Nirvana is swayed.  \n\nA happy ending for us would be the best gift in the world. Where we all get what we deserve and don\'t leave a trail of tears behind our caskets. He did what he had to do, fixed himself up, dusted himself off and got right. But it doesn\'t work like that, not in this world. And the overly friendly guys who corner me after the meeting know that. They are like me, just operating on some kind of higher frequency that allows them to accept the bad things and not think it\'s all bullshit. Or they put on a hell of a mask and are secretly unsure that this, or anything else, will be able to cure the hurt and damage done. It\'s a few of the same of the borderline confrontational phrases used to distill our entire psychology into a sentence so we can digest it and and repeat it when some of us inevitably disappear. They are not far off in their definitions and platitudes. But trying to understand addiction is like chasing the wind. And in an addicts mind the truth is blurred and undecided, only to be reveled by the series of split-second decisions that will eventually determine our future. If a platitude carved into a block of wood ever got and kept someone sober I would surely like to meet him. Shake his hand and admire his single-mindedness. \n\n""if you change NOTHING then NOTHING CHANGES"" I can imagine it now.\n\nWith all the resources we have we still can\'t figure out how to stop addicts from killing ourselves. If it wasn\'t so tragic, it would be comical. I sometimes think about an animal doing it. A heard of deer, one after one, following each other into an electric fence and being fried by the current. It would probably get a lot of view on youtube i\'d wager. But when it\'s me I expect some unobtainable and undeserved level of empathy. I\'m the victim and the perpetrator rolled into one, trying to quell my nature for long enough to make it home safe tonight. Tomorrow is just another unknown.\n \nMaybe he\'ll take over again tomorrow and try to kill me. Because fun. Fun. Nothingness is fun. Feelings are not fun. And is it such a crime to have a little fun when you\'ve done so well recently? Is it? Because I really don\'t know. Why does this have to be so serious? Let it be formally known I don\'t think the punishment fits the crime. The idea that I can either stand up, introduce myself as an addict and work within this paradigm like a broken horse or walk outside and die. Well THAT doesn\'t seem fair. But i\'m just an observer sitting in this chair with no power besides a hope and a prayer. Let it roll I guess. \n'"

3lwdpy,cannablissy,9/21/2015 23:38:02,b'Question about dosing;',"b'Hey fam, just a quick question that I may even end up answering on my own, but just want some verification to make sure I understand,\n\nI usually take 60mg oxy a day, all at once. I did this yesterday, then about 6-7 hours later I took 45mg oxy, but literally felt no effects. I\'m not even sure my high was maintained at this point, I felt no nod, little euphoria, etc.\n\nMy question is, was this because I\'m used to a 60mg dosing, & when I did 45mg it didn\'t stack on to the 60mg I had in my system, but rather just acted as a method to ""maintain"" the current high I had going? They say take every 4-6 hours but I was probably at the 7 hour mark if I\'m being real, so maybe there wasn\'t anything left to maintain? \n\nJust trying to figure out if it\'s tolerance issues or dosing issues. In my mind, 105mg in one day might be the most I\'ve done in a while, but if it was spread out at 60mg and 45mg, it wouldn\'t be like taking 105mg at once, correct? \n\nSorry if this is common science, I\'ve just never not had any effect happen to me in a while, lmao. I just took 30mg today, at once, & felt better but not euphoric for obvious reasons, so I feel like I should have felt that 45mg dosing regardless. \n\nThanks for any insight!'"

I still think about using everyday and I know it\'s inevitable when I go and visit my hometown, where all of my connects are. I\'m finally in college doing normal things with normal people which is what I always wanted to go back to, but it will never be the same. I feel like I\'ll never be satisfied and I\'m destined to live the short, disappointing life of a young addict.

In a similar position as I was a little over a year ago. My mind is slowly coming back to me. Enough at least to where I can no longer ask myself ""How did I get here?"" I know damn well how I got to this point and I know I did it all to myself. Maybe I had a little help along the way. Enablers come and go. But in the end no one forces us to smoke that blunt, to sniff that line, and they sure as hell don\'t force the needle into our veins. That wasn\'t my experience at least. \n\nThis last binge has been one of the longest and hardest I have put my body and mind through. I know I can\'t keep doing this to myself. So why then do I continue down the path to self destruction? I can make excuses till I\'m blue in the face but in the end getting high is just easier. It\'s easier than coming to terms with the fact that I have a problem that I just continue to let grow and fester like an oozing abscess. It\'s easier than staring into the cold blue eyes of that demon which mimics my every move. It\'s easier than watching my mother break down in tears for the hundredth time begging me to just make her understand the reasons behind it all.\n\nI had it all. The world at my fingertips begging for me to take it by the reins. And I pissed it all away. I made the decisions that have made me who I am today. And I wouldn\'t trade all the dope in the world for the life experiences I have gained along the way. But I still have regrets.\n\nPlease feel free to leave feedback good or bad.

I am a chipper who snorts while C is a full-blown addict who shoots. For a long time, C would help me get dope, but always middle. I would always hook her up well, but obviously I would prefer a real connect and I tried to make this known to her. I went out of town for the summer and last saw her when I came back at the beginning of August. I asked her if she could help me get a g. C offered to do me one better. She\'d introduce me to her connect in exchange for .2. I was perfectly happy to do this as that\'s probably what I would\'ve given her anyway. When we met B, he hooked C up with a free g for the new customer. They seemed very chill with one another, and it was good dope.\n\nI continued to cop from him through penultimate week of August, then stopped.

I have hit him up twice in the last 3 weeks but he has not responded at all. \n\n\nWell today I finally got B\'s new number and texted him to see if I could get a g today. He texts back a half hour later or so saying yeah, but I have to go get a new phone so I tell him I\'ll be a while.

C texts me and tells me she can get better dope than B has for the same price and she could pick me up from where I was. This sounds good to me so she comes and gets me and we cop. On the way she is telling me that B hasn\'t been answering calls from her all morning and when I mentioned he had texted me she is peeved. She tries to call him again but he doesn\'t answer. I think she thought her phone was maybe fucking up, so she asked if she could use mine. I call B and when he picks up I tell him ""one second"" and hand the phone to her. She starts talking to him and it quickly becomes clear that he was avoiding her phone calls because he\'s pissed at her over a car which he bought from her recently which has some issue that just came to light and is getting mad at her over piddling amounts of money he said he\'d pay her related to the car, like $50 or something. C was calm and wasn\'t yelling or acting hostile she was really just confused as to why he was mad.\n\n\nWhen they finally get off the phone I immediately text B and apologize for giving her the phone as I had no idea they had any kind of disagreement. He texts me back telling me ""he ain\'t ones to play games wit"". I honestly don\'t care if I lose him as a connect because apparently he cuts with brown sugar now and I\'m not interested in that. But still feel like I kinda got fucked over being in the middle here. Like I didn\'t do shit but still get fucked out of a connect. For letting someone use my phone... Oh well. I\'m high.'"

3lupvm,49ersFan80,9/21/2015 15:57:03,b'Has anyone had experience trying DXM alone to lower their tolerance even faster on a drug holiday?',"b'Hi Friends~\n\nSo I\'m having trouble getting any effect from my prescription pain meds (for a legit back fracture) and am taking two weeks off of Rx opiates in an attempt to lower my tolerance some. Now, I saw a neurochemistry lecture at uni where the Chief of Anesthesiology and Pain Management M.D. said that dextromethorphan hydrobromide  when used alone can help increase neural plasticity (i.e. help lower tolerances by healthily ""rewiring"" drugged out and otherwise habituated brains). I\'ve also read the published scientific study where they found 30mg/kg of DXM alone fully reset morphine tolerances in addicted rats to ""nave"" levels. \n\nSo I\'ve gone and got this idea that abstinence off ALL toxins will help lower my opiate tolerance a little bit, and that taking DXM should theoretically help boost the results some. Now 30mg/Kg is obviously a potentially lethal dose of DMX for humans, so that is out & therefore I doubt I\'ll get opiate-nave like the rats in the study, but it sounds reasonable that sipping on OTC DXM will help a little.  \n\nSo my question is, has anyone else tried this, and if so, how much would you say this helped? Also, how much DXM did you take and how often & over what time span? (I\'m guessing a bit higher dose of DMX will work better than a small one, but I am not willing to RoboWalk just to lower my opiate tolerance an extra 1%.) \n\nEDIT: I actually cut out all OTC and Rx drugs, coffee, cigarettes, liquor, unhealthy foods, dairy (contains casomorphin opiates). I assume this will help my brain & liver heal up and rewire all of itself even faster than just taking time off only opes. The first few days with no coffee, smokes, or pizza was pure hell, but I feel strangely good again now that I\'m fully detoxed 10 days into this thing.'"

3lugur,notchefsthrowaway,9/21/2015 14:56:54,"b'Ladies and Gentlemen... Open minded misfits from all walks of life, please come join the party, and chat with us!'","b'(TL;DR- New skype group for those who may, or may not be high, and just want to socialize with like minded, fun new friends from all over the world. Please private message me for more info. Thanks!)\n\nHey everyone. Some of you may have seen my previous posts, but for those who haven\'t, I implore you to check out my previous submissions and get involved. But to summarize, I\'ve been trying to create a large ongoing group chat for fun, outgoing, talkative party/drug-friendly folks interacting with one another, at each individuals\' own convenience. So for those days/nights that you\'re just chilling alone at home, or even when hanging with a couple friends, and you feel like chatting with people from around the world whom share the same \'interests\', here we have a forum where you can do that either in text forum, or even group calls/video.\n\nBeing someone who often ends up getting high alone in the boring confines of my bedroom, I also find that the only times I\'m ever feeling social, outgoing, friendly, or eager to listening to interesting/hilarious new people is when I\'m in such a cloudy mindset. Not being too impressed with the current options like IRC, Tripsit, etc., I felt compelled to create a different, better outlet for social interaction, as well making great new friends. In figuring out my goals, it became important to create ""an environment"" where people are free to be themselves, speak openly, do their thing, and be without any of the paranoia that oftentimes comes along with meeting new ""party-friendly"" peers. \n\nFor the record, the group has nothing to do with sourcing or the solicitation of any drugs, nor has connections to any vendors. Its simply a never-ending conversation where one can chat, ask questions, seek input/feedback, shoot the sht, network, or whatever the hell comes to our warped minds, along with other similarly thinking people from all over. However unlike while being out in public, the bonus is that here you\'re actually encouraged to show up and chat while partaking in whatever substances one might be into. So whether you\'re slamming, blowing clouds, doing lines, popping pills or whatever you may be into, as long as you\'re not gonna be aggressive, paranoid, creepy, or cause any kind of drama, then lets text or get on cam in a group setting and have some fun, while still in the safe confines of home. Or, with skype being free and easy to download on phones, tablets, laptops, etc etc, well as long as you have wi-fi, you have an easy means of popping in to say hello, no matter where you are. \n\nNow with all that said, its also clear that no party is complete without a good ratio of men to women, and right now we could definitely use more outgoing, participating females. Just so its clear, all female members will be treated with respect, and so there shouldn\'t be concern about creepy dudes bombarding female members with inappropriate messages or behavior. That sht simply wont be tolerated, so dont worry about it being like every other tweaker chat out there. I simply wanted to create a forum that we all can pop into, and step away from, at any given time for a chill, fun and stress-free chat with other friendly, like minded, and well-intentioned party people.\n\nSo... Ladies and Gentlemen, boys and girls, this new skype group is already off to an exciting and promising start, but we\'d love to have more of you. If any of this sounds interesting and you\'d at least like to give it a try, please do get in touch at your soonest convenience. Just send me a private message on here, lets talk, exchange Skype details, connect on there, and I\'ll soon get you added to the group. As I\'ve already stated, we\'ve got a great thing going, and some really awesome people already active, chatting throughout the day, every day, but it truly isn\'t a party until you show up. So please, get in touch and lets make this the most fun, and undoubtedly highest group chat on Skype. Its gonna be fun, so come check it out. Till then, thanks so much for your time!'"

3lsggq,jp79219,9/21/2015 5:45:56,b'How many strikes should an opiate addict be given?',"b'I\'ve had issues with one particular 21-22 year old Heroin Addict that I met, and is an acquaintance more than a friend.  Well anyway this kid from the get go was the type of kid (for one he\'s a middle man with no job or cell phone) that you can\'t trust farther than you can throw him...if you don\'t have arms.\n\nWell anyway my question is how many chances can you give a dope hear before you are forced to ""discipline"" them via ass beating, leaving them in the hood with no ride, trash them on Reddit or another form of teaching them a lesson?\n\nDo you think it depends on the offense or the amount of times they do something that counts as a strike in your life?\n\nHere\'s what he did to me.....\n\n1. I pretty sure he pinched out of my bags, but can\'t be proven...My other buddy he has middle before said that he picked up from him and jumped from one car to another but the bags just appear to be small.  So I gave that one a ""push"".  But I think he pinched my bags...\n\n2.  I gave him 50 bucks because he had done something to  lead me to believe we were ""cool"" and I was considered an actual friend that he wouldn\'t try and pull any shit..WRONG!  I get a text. Bro the girl who drove me grabbed all but one of those bags!  The girl was an innocent non junkie and I highly doubt this kid would let heroin out of his site. So I\'m super pissed off of course cause that was my last cash for a bit.  He said ""oh things like this make me cut myself"" I didn\'t fall for that story...So I had to drive to his house 3 separate times to get 3 bags total of my 50!  That was DEF strike 1 and I almost just said fuck it and beat his ass.  I couldn\'t prove he hustled me, but I wasn\'t planning on anymore BS...But alas I\'m too nice.\n\n3.  I asked him if he has subs to sell. he said I\'m low but yes...So I go to his house and put the cash in a shirt pocket. he supposed to take shirt and get his cash and toss in the subs for me. I get home and 3 subs are 2!  I call him bitching and his answer was ""well I told you I was running low!""  You dumb fuck than don\'t sell 3 to me...You still charged me! Then I straight up told him..Dude next time I\'m gonna just beat your ass no mercy! And he said ok.\n\n4....I see him post a FB saying his mom has some sealed bottles of really expensive lotion that retailed 2 bottle for about 300 bucks...I offered him 40 and he jumped all over it.  Brings them over and my GF buys them.  They looked sealed and when she opened them I knew he had hustled...The lotion inside was fucking Lubriderm! I know the smell and texture. The slimy fuck has shrink wrap an sealed the shit up..He would of gotten away with it too if it was someone more trusting..After that he checked into rehab the next day before I was able to confront him and ask.  I thought about just asking his mother about it.\n\nSo what do you think?  I\'m a dumbass for being nice and not a Pablo Escobar no mercy type guy..I just shocked someone so grimy for 10 bucks man! lol  \n\nThis kid blew to opportunities to get in close with two dudes with cars and cash flow who would be willing to help out when he\'s hurting, give him rides and not tax the shit out of him and just plain old friendship!\n\nIt more important ot burn someone for 5 bags than to get 2 indefinitely every time you are taken to go score...Middlemen are a strange group of people...\n\nSo what do you think?  How many strikes does your system use?  I\'m curious if I\'m the minority in the dope game and am way too nice?

I\'m something of a  ""chipper"" with H, though I\'d describe myself as more of a poly drug user, with weed being my only constant. I\'ve been in the coke, meth, molly, psychedelic, and other drug scenes, with dope being my most recent. Here\'s the experience I had tonight.\n\nI found a guy using a certain other subreddit, and have gone through him a few times. I know it is risky to use the internet to cop, but none of us would be here if we didn\'t take risks, right? Any way, I hit up this guy at around 9pm. I need a half G, and he says he can do it. I realize I don\'t currently have access to a car (my wife needed it to go to work, and we only have one car), but he says he\'ll deliver! Score!\n\nHe\'s definitely a middle man who does it to support his own habit, but I never give money in advance, so I wasn\'t worried about being ripped off or anything. He lets me know he will be by my place at around 11:30 with the dope. So I patiently wait. 11:30 rolls around, and I haven\'t even heard from him, so I panic a little bit. I text him, and he replies a few minutes later. He says he is finally leaving his guy\'s place and headed to me. He says it took so long because his guy wanted to chill for a few (you know how that shit goes). I reply ""no worries, see ya in 20"". \n\n30 minutes later, he texts me to let me know that he had to pull over and use the bathroom ""suddenly and unexpectedly"". I give him the benefit of the doubt, of course. We all have had that happen, right? So he says it will be there by 12:30am at the latest. I reply no worries. I was watching WWE Night Of Champions (Pro Wrestling, I know. I love it and don\'t care what anyone else thinks!), so I knew time would pass quickly. \n\nAs I\'m watching WWE, I realize it is about 1:30am, and I haven\'t heard anything. As I look at my phone to begin to send a text, I get a call from a number I don\'t have stored in my phone. I answer and it\'s him. He explains that he got sick as fuck (not withdrawals) and is currently in the bathroom at some gas station 15 minutes from me. He apologized about 10 times in between throwing up. He tells me he sent his girlfriend, who was with him, on to drop it off to me. I tell him it\'s no problem and to feel better. \n\nAbout 20 minutes later, his girlfriend pulls up to my place. I give her the cash and she hands me two bags, instead of one. This dude felt so bad for making me wait, he gave me 0.6g of dope and 0.2 of coke as a freebie for making me wait. I wasn\'t even mad that he took long to get it to me, but that he threw in extra and some coke was really bad ass.\n\nBottom line is: We\'ve all been fucked over at one time or another, but when dealers go the extra mile like mine did tonight, it makes us appreciate it a little bit more.\n\nHope you guys are having a fantastic night. I know I (now) am!\n\n**TL;DR Dealer took an extra two hours to DELIVER my dope. Threw me a point extra and a free two points of coke to make up for it and keep my business.**'"

My mom knew something was wrong so she went to get my brother who broke down the door and found me lifeless in the floor. The ambulance came, and saved my life. ( honestly I wish they wouldn't have) I was told by my family I kept saying I didn't want help. I suffer from depression and anxiety. This drug took me far away from those feelings, but what I realize now is that it took away a lot more than just the pain. It took my soul. The next day when I finally came to. I felt something was missing. It didn't take long to realize what was missing was my soul. That day I went to my brothers house, and we were talking and I told him he wasn't talking to who he thought he was talking to, and I really meant it. He didn't quite understand though, and told me. That I was still not in the right mind, and I'm kind of speaking crazy. Its been a year from that incident, and I don't know who I am anymore. I can't find a center within myself.

Went from being in control, happy, healthy, to feeling very trapped and have no idea what to do.'","b'I had started using Oxy 10/325 after an injury had me bedridden and in extreme pain for several weeks. The injury caused some nerve damage that made it difficult to walk, stand up, or sit down. \n\nBy continuing to medicate I was able to go back to work without excruciating pain and still provide for myself. After Rx had run out, I found a reliable source of time released OP 40MG that I would divide in to half, taking one first thing in the morning and the other half at night. \n\nThis went on for several months, and as my pain levels gradually subsided, I became very fond of the recreational aspect and started using more. \n\nAt the highest point I was using ~120 mg per day, every day. I started to feel like this was too much, and after maintaining this ~120/day use for 6 weeks, I started to taper back to the 40mg/day that I had started out with. \n\nThe taper dose was not nearly as effective as it was before, so It was difficult to maintain this and I would sometimes go back up to 60, 80 or even 100 mg\'s a day, depending on pain levels and other psychological factors. It has been about 2 months since I was tapered down and I found out that it was very difficult for me to control my use, as I wanted to constantly use more, and if my supply was good, I would. \n\nRecently, my supply left town unexpectedly. I found myself with nothing, and even after exhausting all options, came up empty handed. \n\nThis is where things got bad. I had not gone a single day without having at least 40mg\'s of OP for 6-7months and the first day without anything was absolutely hell. \n\nI had someone offer me ""Brown"" which could be smoked to ""get well"" \n\nI tried this, and it did absolutely nothing for me. I went through a hefty amount in less than 8 hours and never felt more than what a 5/325 would do for me.... and that could have very well been placebo because my W/D never actually was relieved at all. I had a feeling that this was some B.S. fake shit, and it smelled like burnt brown sugar when heated up, so I had the same person get some different stuff that was said to be much better. \n\nAgain, tried this before purchasing it, smoking a Q-tip head sized blob up from foil, and it did ABSOLUTELY nothing. At this point I am extremely frustrated and can\'t believe that I went down this road and am actually kind of relieved that it did not work... but wtf, why won\'t this work for me, it is supposedly the strongest opiate one can get their hands on.\n\nLuckly I was able to find some Instant release oxy, but the cost was easily 200% more than my usual connect. It took 30mg\'s to feel baseline ""normal"" and I have been doing my best to keep dosing low just enough to keep the W/D\'s away. \n\nAt this point, I am trying to think of a way to get off of this stuff completely. I had never experienced being ""sick"" before and what a fucking miserable experience. I do not want to be a slave to taking something that if gone, will completely ruin my well-being. However now I don\'t know how to be well without it, as pain levels from the injury are still high, some days are better than others. \n\nAnyone with similar experience please help me get pointed in the right direction\n'"

Enjoy it or do something else or whatever.)  \n  \n  \nIt was somewhere near noon. July in ohio can be beautifully unforgiving. I got a call from a friend, recently sober, who said she wanted to go swimming. I agreed without hesitation.  \nWe picked up another friend and headed for a local lake, stocked with beer and plastered-on smiles.You see, at this point, we\'ve all been off the needle for about three weeks. It wasn\'t a mutual pact or anything, just coincidental timing that would forever change our lives.  \nFor all you would-be warriors out there, here\'s the worst part of withdrawal: the aftermath. After you get past the cold sweats and diarrhea, insomnia and irritability, you get the real treat. Depression, one unlike anything you\'ve ever known. Doctors call it anhedonia. Look up that word on wikipedia; it\'s not at all.inaccurate to how you feel after the physical withdrawal wears off.  \nI think that\'s why many addicts relapse. They all know withdrawal; they can feel the storm brewing, hear the rumbling thunders of discomfort in the distance. Then, just after they think the storm has passed, a hurricane hits. It doesn\'t feel like much. It doesn\'t feel like anything. If I were to describe it to you, had you never experienced it, you\'d say it was all in my head.  \nThat\'s the thing. It is all in the head. And that\'s where the nastiest aspects of who you are as a person like to hang out.  \nBack at the lake, a few beers and many laughs in, the subject of addiction comes up. This leaks into heroin, which cascades into what our old drug dealers are doing now that we\'re not dropping benjamins on them daily.  \nThe look between the three of us came so swiftly, that I\'m not sure any of us realized it at first. The decision was nonverbal yet lucid. This would be the day that we stopped stopping. We\'ve all run the cycle too many times now; why not just give in? Any self-justification you can think of, it was there, alive and ready to tell us that yes, we do deserve a little taste, if not a full lick. Life passes moment by moment, and then, one day, there are no more moments. Why not enjoy every single one to its fullest?  \nAll that bullshit.  \nWe get our money together. I look for mine -- pockets full of empty. Shit. They still have about $120 between them, guess I\'ll have to pay back my due the next time we see each other. Surprisingly, neither of them objected to this. This could be because we\'ve all been really good friends for a long time, or because I\'m the only one with a car and a license. Either way, doesn\'t matter. I get mine.  \nWe trek up from what amounts to us as backwoods wilderness into the south side of the inner city. Copped a half, drove to my place, got the gear ready. They fixed up first; I expected this, being basically a beggar.  \nThen came my turn. He poked around my arm a bit, but finally registered. Out goes the blood, in goes the nectar. And just like that, the world was okay again. My shitty job was alright because, fuck it, why care? My fallen friends, all now resting eternally in wooden boxes, dead beneath about six feet of living earth, they were afterthoughts, sad as it is to say. I remembered them as they were, not where they are now.  \nMy directionless life? Fuck a compass.  \n  \nThese are the lies we tell ourselves, and it\'s difficult to disbelieve something if your own brain is the one commanding your mouth to spew it out at others.'"

So much happened in my life last year, and yet most of it still seems like a blur. This was the year I hit bottom. My addiction reached the worst depths of my entire life to date, and for the first time I could no longer hide what was going on with me from the people closest to me. This year my family, friends and girl all learned just how bad things had gotten; that I was an addict and a  seriously bad one at that. I burned through almost all of my savings, and did irreparable damage to my credit that I may never be able to fix. I was hospitalized three different times for accidents or benzo or opiate related issues. This year marked the first time I officially tried to quit as well. I made it three weeks sober before I relapsed. There were many points during the year that I thought it was a foregone conclusion that I would be joining the 27 club and never make it to this day.\n\nAt the same time, I feel like I have a lot to look forward to. I'm extremely lucky to have retained the love and support of my family, friends, and most importantly my girl. I moved to a new city that I love, and was able to cut out and leave behind some of the worse influences on myself. I'm attending therapy for the first time and it has been extremely helpful. Even though I am still using, my use has gone way way down and feels manageable again. I have a new job that I really like. I am also starting to save money again and have paid off the majority of the debt that I have racked up.

There were some people who said they've tried it, it worked, and got high as shit, and others said it didn't work at all....and basically just wasted all of their shit. Some say vapes wont work at all because they need to burn at x amount of degrees, and others say that most vape pens and e-cigs will work *because* they most all burn at x amount of degrees. \n\nI'm really surprised that this topic isn't brought up more often, and when it is brought up, it doesn't bring much attention;\nI mean shit, if I had the money I would buy like an 8ball and a shit ton of different vape pens and e-hookahs and see what worked and what didn't. If I don't find out the answer by tax season, or when some unexpected bonus $$ falls into my lap, I'm gonna take this shit into my own hands, and mark my words I'll make sure you are the first to know haha. \n\nThis shit would be like... revolutionary to the game;straight up fucking game changer.

You could just  spark up wherever your are, walk down the street and take a puff, drivie down the road and hit that dope with confidence, no one would bat an eye.  I just realized that this is kind of starting to sound like an infomercial lol; but you get my point!\n\nSo, is there anyone who knows for certain, or at least is fairly confident that tar can be smoked being vaporized through an e-cig or a vape pen? If so, what was the brand or type of vaporizer that you have had experience with that worked for you? """

About an hours work for 40  Also on my all nighter I binge watched Narcos on Netflix and can't recommend it enough !!  Only quibble is the amount of subtitles that are right at the bottom of the screen and takes away from the action . But it's a great series and can't wait for season 2 . I had no idea how much Pablo Escobar had the government in his pocket and totally terrified of him ! Some of the stuff is completely unbelievable if it didn't actually happen ! IE SPOILER ! When he turns himself in after he builds his own lavish jail ! .?? Lolz WTF !!  \n  Anyways I had to cold cop on Friday and the stuff was pretty shit but a good 10 bag was defenetly over 0.2 g a nice sized lil rock and some powder though it was quite yellow in appearance took it in town in a disabled Tesco toilet as I couldn't wait . It got me well ....barely and started going into WD about 12am that night brought I managed to get a few hours sleep . \n  So I had been up all night and decided to phone my gran at about 9am unfortunately I woke her up so she told me she'd phone back as she couldn't think of any jobs I could do . She phoned back in 20 minutes wanting me to paint the hut that she recently purchased and said my grandpa would come and get me . But I said I was happy to bike it to her house (3/4 miles) as I could do with the exercise . Also I could hardly get my grandpa to stop off at my dealers on the way home ! So got there in about 25 minutes and I think she was determined to pick me up ! As she said she phoned back after I hung up to say they would come and get me . As she worries a lot and thought the bike ride to her house would be to dangerous as I don't have a helmet and it's quite a bad road, loads of ppl have died on it  including a couple of friends/neighbours  But I quickly got changed and was out the door sharpish so missed her call . \n  When I was at my dealers I was wanting 3/4 of a gram for 30 but he didn't have any tenner bags made up and had bought a half Oz of rolling tobacco as I was out and had run out at about 3am the night before so I couldn't even chain smoke ! Like I normally do in WD for some reason . Though it's maybe a good thing as I still have 15 left and can scrape up a fiver for a half G on Tuesday if I can make this one last two days . \n  I'm feeling pretty good now  and hope every one is doing good and hope everyone is having a chilled Sunday ! It's honestly my least favourite day as a lot of things are closed and the place is like a ghost town  not good if your trying to make some money ! So happy nods peeps ! """

3lnblr,superultimatejesus,9/20/2015 0:34:57,b'I had no idea',"b'I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. I couldn\'t position the cord properly on my bicep, I couldn\'t tie it correctly, I couldn\'t feel around the crook of my arm and find a vein. Shit, this is so much work, how do daily IV users do it?  \nLet\'s go back a bit. I\'ve always snorted heroin. I\'ve shot before, but always had someone else do the deed. On one particular night, a longtime friend with whom there exists a notable sexual tension (this isn\'t bragging, it\'s crucial to the story) and I ventured to the south side and copped. She picked up a few points while we were there. She prefers to shoot. So it goes.  \nWe get back to my place and as I look for a surface to snort from, a card, and a straw or receipt, I turn my head back and she\'s already heating the spoon. Here I am scrambling for simple pre-industrial tools, and she\'s already mastered twentieth century technology. You can guess who the professional is here.  \nI sit positioned behind her, holding her arm up and helping her tie stay tight. She pokes in the syringe and registers on the first hit. The fluid goes into her arm effortlessly. I apply an alcohol swab and undo the tie as she leans back towards me in euphoria. I get up, and sit across from her, face to face. Her eyes have noticeably softened and a effortless half-crook of a smile adorns her thin lips.  \nI think I\'m in love. I think I\'m fucked up.  \nI ask her, in an awkward tone, if she can use the other needle on me. She opens her mouth to.speak, her eyes narrow slightly, but just as swiftly widen to those soft doe eyes I know and love. Her mouth closes into a wide smile. \n""Sure. If you want to.""\nI wasnt sure I did. But after we cooked up and tied my arm off, as I sat across from her in mere inches, I knew I was sure. She held my arm as I pumped my fist, rested lightly on her thigh. She felt around for a vein and found one. The professional fader she is, she registered on first attempt. The plunger went down, then up a bit, then down, several times in a rollercoaster of euphoria that only climbs and never falls.  \nShe pulled the needle out and swabbed the injection site. It hits me. Warmth, that familiar place you all know that reminds you of an orgasm but in a completely paradoxically different way. My stance lowers. My eyelids fall, and my eyes fall in turn, into hers, holding that crushing gaze for what felt like several eternities. I was flattened, right then and there. This is the opposite of a fairytale love story.  \nFast forward several nights, and I came home after copping a half. I planned on just snorting it, but as I sat down to open the wrap, I turned my head and saw an insulin syringe on my end-table, still inIits packaging. If fate exists, this was its tendrils moving my feet on the oath of my own destiny.  \nI tried for ten minutes to get the tie in correctly. In one hand, a vessel full of a light brown honey of the gods, and In the other hand, a fucking phone charger which mocks my sudden inability to tie a knot. \nIt\'s tied. I pump my arm, and feel around on my arm for a good vein, trying to remember how she did it. I locate the vein, and rather clumsily insert the needle. I let it rest and tried to pull back on the plunger, which was surprisingly difficult to achieve with only one available hand. I manage to pull back. Nothing. I pull the needle out, tighten the knot, and pump my hand a bit more. A bulge sticks out, right near where she hit me a few days earlier. I insert the needle an inch away from that now sacred site. I pull back. Nothing. Minutes pass, but I\'m too determined by now to consider quitting. I move the needle one last time..and blood pours in. I pull back. A beautiful cascade of rosy liquid coalesces with the salt-lake sunset awaiting in the needle. I push down. I pull up, more blood comes in, I in turn push the rest in. Undo the tie. Swab my arm. Soften my eyes, release an uncontrollable smile.  \n  \nAnd that was it. I taught myself what may perhaps be one of the most dangerous  pieces of knowledge known to man. That was a year ago. I don\'t snort anymore. My love, my beautiful disaster, was taken by the rise of fentanyl cut in the spring. I still reach for the needle regardless.  \nI\'m still not sure who exactly I fell in love with on that fateful day.'"

Be warned, this is kind of a long post so bear with me.\n\n\nFor the past year or so, I have been doing painkillers almost everyday. I am a college student at a good university, I have always made fairly good grades, and I actually have long-term goals and aspirations despite being a junkie. Ever since my freshman year, I have sold drugs (everything from weed to coke to lsd to painkillers) and lived a pretty lavish lifestyle as a result of having so much extra cash. For a while, I was only selling these drugs--not doing them--and life was great.\n\n\nFlash-forward two years, and a lot of shit starts happening in my life at once. One of my good friends dies from a drug overdose, and literally the next day I find out that my girlfriend is pregnant. Naturally, I became pretty bummed and stressed out, and started experimenting with painkillers to alleviate my emotional pain. I basically had an unlimited supply of oxy 30's (blues) and all sorts of crushable opanas. I immediately fell in love with these drugs and began doing them all day, everyday. \n\n\nFast-forward another year to present day, and this lifestyle has finally caught up with me. Whereas I used to be making about $1000 a week selling drugs, I have now completely blown through all of this money and I am now also in credit card debt. My family has noticed changes in my behavior, as I am often in a state of withdrawals whenever I come home or whenever I am around them in general.\n\n\nTired of living this hellish junkie lifestyle, I made up my mind that I was going to quit about two weeks ago. I had gone through withdrawals plenty of times and knew what to expect, so I stocked up on supplies to deal with the withdrawals and got through them. I am now in the PAWS stage, and the anxiety and depression has been extremely difficult for me to handle. In a moment of drunken weakness, I told my sister about my problems and explained that I had been acting so strangely lately because I was going through post-acute withdrawal symptoms and that my brain was trying to revert back to its original, pre-junkie form. \n\n\nNaturally, she completely freaked out and was 100% NOT OKAY with it. I made her promise me not to tell my parents about it because I felt like I had done a good job handling being opiate-free so far and I didn't want my parents to fuck up my life and send me to rehab or something. However, I'm pretty sure she told my parents anyway as everyone in my family has been acting very weirdly towards me lately and I can definitely tell that something is up.\n\n\nI have a lot going on in my life right now and the stress of worrying about all of this has made me relapse. I feel hopeless and I don't know who to turn to as none of my friends know about the extent of my problems and obviously I don't want to talk to my parents about it. \n\n\nGood people of r/opiates, can you offer me some advice on how I should go about this situation and what I should do/say if my parents do end up asking me about this? I have never gotten in trouble in my life and I am considered the golden child of my family; my parents' world would be turned upside down if they found out about everything. Any input on my situation would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\n"""

I really enjoy the ritual of scooping out some powder, or breaking a piece off the rock, crushing it up, making my line, getting out my trusty red straw, and then for some reason I do half in one nostril and half in the other. Don't know why. Just a weird thing I guess. I like the taste of the drip too. I think I like the ritual of it almost as much as the warm and fuzzy feeling. I wouldn't even want to go back to pills because I like sniffing so much. How much am I missing out by not banging. Does it keep tolerance lower when you snort it? Anyone have any tips on maximising the high when snorting? I haven't been doing this very long, and I just feel like talking if anyone wants to. """

Here is what I experienced as far as physiological effects/withdrawals/cravings so far:\n\n-Blood Pressure increase for several days (Hypertensive levels)\n\n-Mild constipation on day 2\n\n-Slight insomnia trying to sleep on night 2 (I did get 4 hours though).\n-No Restless Leg Syndrome.\n\n-I noticed I wasn\'t very happy at work on either day 2 or 3 (Which is odd considering I kinda have a lot of fun at work... Usually).\n\n-No real cravings all week.  Although, I am pretty bored right now... Typing this is actually the biggest trigger I\'ve had all week.\nI think it\'s a false sense of freedom from hard withdrawals.\n\n-Considering copping a 20 sac right now (See bullet point above for dumbass reasoning), but not sure if I\'ve waited long enough.\n\n-Still feel itchy as fuck for some reason, even before I relapsed, I don\'t understand it at all, it\'s exactly the same itch you get from dope except it doesn\'t feel good to scratch - It\'s just annoying.  Sometimes I itch till I bleed.  I hope this isn\'t permanent, or just some allergy that I\'m not aware of.\n\n\nSide Notes:\n\n-Did not get fired, lose friends, or loved ones.\n\n-No close call with an overdose.\n\n-My main cast I\'m usually around knew that I was noticeably ""Off"" and highly suspected my relapse on the day I used, but it felt as though I was being super stealth about it (Eye drops, trying not to mumble, trying not to nod off, etc..).  They were about 51% sure, but they ended up giving me the benefit of the doubt.\n\n\nConclusion: I really love being able to sleep, poop, and enjoy things other than dope.  But I almost equally love dope.  I don\'t entirely regret my relapse, yet..\n\n\nAny thoughts, concerns, questions, personal experiences, or comments welcomed.'"

3llpxx,MyFirstDay,9/19/2015 16:10:42,b'D boyz that act like homies. It is like the dope version of Sal in pinapple express.',"b'So everyone has dealt with that type of dealer who strings you along and plays the hurry up and wait game. Let\'s share our stories about those times where your dealer feels like Sal from pinapple express.\n\nHere is my story from last night..\n\nI live in the 208 which does not have an open market and higher prices since everything gets ran up from a neighboring state\'s hub city which is about 5 hours each way. So anyways it is hard to find a good d boy in my capital city. \n\nI met this guy a couple weeks ago after I started buying ounces of ganja from him. At this time I had a guy already but the prices were higher and he was a MM so it was difficult to score because of his work schedule and his d girls schedule.\n\nSo one night I wanted to score but normal guy was not happening. So I was at the ganja man\'s house and was really wanting some dope so I took a shot in the dark and asked him ""what else do you fuck with?"" And out of nowhere he went unexpected thug life on me and busted out; meth, tar, acid, shrooms, & roxy. So I was like fuck yeah and bought a couple bags from him. Went home and it got me pretty lit so I started going through him since he had it on hand instead of MM.\n\nSo the first couple deals went alright, in and out in 15 or 20 mins. Yesterday I waited all day for him to get off work so I could come through, which is usually 5pm. Apparently he had busier than normal day and I try not to be pushy with him. Waited till 7pm before I get kinda anxious and decide to give him a call, he answered and says he literally just walked in the door to his house and to give him 1 hour. So I\'m like cool I can handle that.\n\nSo I am sitting and waiting, browsing /r/opiates and playing games on the phone trying to pass the time. An hour goes by and I\'m thinking ""cool he should be calling me soon like he said"". I continue trying to pass the time, smoke on my ganja and looking at the clock every 5 minutes. Another hour passes and I\'m getting anxious again, it after 9pm at this point. I really hate to push him, but again decide to call him for an update, figured 2 hours was enough time for him to unwind from work.\n\nSo he doesn\'t answer my call which makes me a little uneasy, but he calls back like 5 minutes later and tells me he had to make a run and will home in ten minutes. I tell him that It takes me atleast 20 mins to drive to his area and ask if I can start driving since he said only ten minutes, but he tells me no and he will call me back soon when he is almost to his house. So I\'m like cool I will wait, 10 minutes is not bad.\n\nBoy was I wrong. Close to an hour goes by and still no call from him. At this point it is 10pm and again I hesitantly called him to see if he is home thinking maybe he forgot about me. He answered and sounded just very slightly annoyed, but tells me I can roll through. So I feel relieved and start driving to his spot.\n\nFinally show up to the trailer park and pull up to his spot to see his truck isn\'t even there. So I call to see where he is and he says he is right around the corner getting smokes. So I am pretty sketched out sitting in my car in a dark ass trailer park in the most ghetto part of my city. It is now close to 11pm. He finally gets home after 10 or 15 minutes and we go inside, with my mind thinking ""ok this won\'t take long"", wrong again.\n\nSo after going inside I can tell he is pretty gacked out on meth. He is talking non stop and is in the kitchen putting dishes away and other random shit while talking like we have known eachother for a life time. After an agonizing 25 minutes or so he finally busted out and we do the exchange. So I start to get ready to mob out and he tells me that I ""CAN NOT LEAVE"" until I smoke some of his ganja because it was new stuff and better than the previous product. So I think ""FUUUCKK... ok not a big deal, I will get stoned for free and then go..""\n\nSo I sit there for like another 20 minutes or so while he sits there and just rolls joint after joint while talking to me the entire time. Meanwhile he has no foil so I can\'t even take a hit while I\'m sitting there. He wanted to smoke some of his tar with me so he puts some inside a joint which I thought was fucking wasteful but I don\'t say anything of course. Finally he hands me the joint and we smoke it for a good 10 minutes and I started to gather my stuff so I can GTFO of there, it\'s past 11:30pm. \n\nMy hand was inches away from opening the front door when he suddenly stops me and tells me he really needs to go somewhere but can\'t take his truck to where he is going and asks for a ride while trying to hand me $10. Since he is the best connect I know at the time I accept the $10 and agree to drive him, even though on the inside I was screaming.\n\nHe makes a call saying to someone that he is on his way (lmfao)..\n I sit back down on the couch while he went into the back room to weigh out God knows what. Takes him 15 minutes and he walks out and goes in the kitchen and starts microwaving some noodles and then sits down and starts eating. At this point I am nearly having a panic attack wanting to go home but having to wait for him while he is slurping on some noodles and talking to me for like 2 minutes in between bites. \n\nNow it is after midnight and he is done eating and we walk outside and start to get in the car, until he says he forgot something and goes back inside. So again I am just sitting in my car in this dark trailer park for what seemed like an hour but was probably 5 minutes. So gets in and we take off. At this point I can really tell he is extremely tweaked out, talking really loud non stop, and there were a couple things he said that were literally non sense and I had no idea what he was actually trying to say. \n\nThen he asks to stop at a gas station so he can get a arizona tea. He walks around doing like 3 laps around the store before he finally pays for his tea and comes back to the car. So I start taking him to drop him off where he needs to go, talking to me the entire time with only half of it coming out right making sense. Finally dropped him off where he needed to go which had been the opposite direction as my house. 30 minute drive and I finally get home to start my ritual. Nearly 1am.\n\nAfter all that I slap a chunk on my foil and take the biggest hits as I could. Then it hit me and I finally feel that ""ooohhh yeaaah, cooooool."" Feeling. Just thought back on the whole night and laughed it off, even while it was happening I was on the verge of a break down. \n\nLong story I know, but if you actually read it thanks fellow /r/opiate friends and I would be happy to see your long wait stories and take the time to read them too!'"

I have some people who are familiar with my regular account, so I've always avoided posting here to keep my deniability in tact. Not very bropiate of me, I know, but I would prefer keeping the knowledge of my habits on the low. \n\nThe nutshell version is I've been hooked for about 6 years now, pills only, and mostly oxy, though I've done months at a time of dilly, morph, hydro, fent; depends on who the main supply at the time is. Never wanted to get involved with dope, though I do IV as of the past 2 years. The point is, with pharms I know exactly what I am getting and know exactly what I can handle, which is a lot, and I've never had any sort of scare whatsoever. Even with fent. Until today. (The exposition is complete, sorry for the long story).\n\nI've been doing fent for two weeks. 50mc Mylans. Been ruining my veins cause I'm an idiot. I've been cooking the whole patch, just not very long, and have been getting about 4 shots before its done and go the bucal route. Today I got interrupted halfway through the process, and ended up leaving the patch in the spoon for an hour or so. I knew that would make for a solid shot when I got back to it, but wasn't really worried. Well, I finished the prep, took a painful shot because I used vinegar, and grabbed my glass of water to clean the rig. Woke up 30 minutes later, facedown on my bed, holding a rig half full of water, and completely soaked, as I had let go of my glass while I went out and it was now empty. I was immediately nauseous and ran to the bathroom but managed to not puke. I have never fallen out before, so I have no idea how close I came to an OD, or if that actually was one, but I can't tell you how scary the feeling was. There was no one in the house to help me. If I had fallen backwards instead of forwards, would I have woken up in time before I puked in my sleep and choked? I have no idea how close I just came to having it end, I'm no expert on ODs, but I definitely have a lot of considering to do, and I think this might have been the thing to set me straight. I hope so at least. \n\nPLEASE STAY AWAY FROM FENTANYL. I have been the safest user I know for 6 years now. Never even considered an OD as I know my exact doses and tolerance.

Being addicted to heroin is awful, it's changed me for the worst and I regret getting in this lifestyle. I don't think I'll ever be able to forget my love of heroin, and I'm sure my physical brain won't ever forget it either. \n\nBut the fucking social stigma is killing me. A lot of problems associated with drug use is ultimately caused by the stigma. Of course, if you never get involved with drugs you won't ever face those problems. But think about it, if we had a program like Switzerland where there is clinics that will give you clean heroin with sanitary injection and a medical staff there to supervise, so many needless deaths would be prevented. So many needless incarcerations would be prevented. So many needless contaction of diseases would be prevented. If the stigma was removed from society, many addicts could carry on employed and safe lives. \n\nBut were forced underground. You have to live double lives bc your family would leave you if they found out and your boss would fire you. People would look down on you if you came out and told everyone. People would stop trusting you around their belongings. \n\nThis is a total pipedream, i know. But i get so depressed when I compare my ideal society with reality. It would be amazing if addicts were supplied safe heroin covered by health insurance, and you wouldn't have to live in fear of being arrested or robbed or overdose caused by fent-laced dope, or fear of withdrawals which certainly is the cause behind most crimes committed by heroin addicts. This kinda feels like a civil rights issue. I don't know, I guess it won't hurt to keep dreaming. """

3ljgn0,ausrfrmphl,9/19/2015 4:39:33,b'back on',"b'Ayy. Just made this account because fucked if I\'m gonna use an actual. I think the first time I used was in the summer after 10th grade before 11th. I\'m a senior in University now. My buddy and I were hanging out basically non stop at this point, and dude had some issues. Basically since he was a kid he said he wanted to do dope... So I knew a guy who knew a guy, and after a while guy who knew a guy came through. We started off snorting. \n\n\nBasically my friend ended up always copping for us. I never bothered actually calling the dealers even though I could have. We didn\'t use *that* much early on, just intermittently. Friend started shooting before the summer was out. I refused the first two or three times, but since he didn\'t die I eventually got over my squeamishness. He shot me up for the longest time, but I eventually started doing it for myself. Took me a while. I never did like letting someone else get me, but he insisted. He was much better and I couldn\'t always hit early on so it worked, and I trusted him.  \n\n\nI\'m not gonna write my whole lifes story here, but suffice it to say I once gave him CPR after OD\'ing on me, he survived. He stole from me, came into my house and stole my stash, ""borrowed"" a lot of money, became a piece of shit. I cut him off. His whole life was fucked. In and out of rehab a few times. Me? I got sort of close to addiction a few times, but in all the years I\'ve been using, I still haven\'t reached that point. Too much school work, too much work work, too much home work. I cannot let my family down, etc. \n\n\nIt\'s been almost a year since I last used heroin, iirc. It\'s not out of frustration with life. I basically did it because I was getting daily cravings, and to be honest, I felt / feel like I can handle it since I have been handling it for 5 years now without incident. Nobody in my family even knows I have used, afaik. They probably have their suspicions but apparently people look up to me and shit in my family. If only they knew... I copped after all this time. \n\n\nI went to wallmart to get some sticks. I knew I wanted a relatively small guage so I just went for 30. Asked for ""30g 1/2"" 10ml"". I could have sworn 10ml were the full sized barrel ones. She said they didn\'t even make 30g 1/2"", which I\'m almost certain is total bullshit. So I asked for some with a similar guage, she gave me 30g shorts instead. 5/16th or whatever. I was worried at first but they actually aren\'t too bad. I missed a few times because it\'s been a while but I found it easier to hit my forearm than the big fucking extruding vein in the crux of my elbow. weird. But now it\'s relatively hot out and I have fucking marks all up where I missed on the crux of my arms. Lol. \n\nI don\'t know. All I can really say is I\'m glad I got the sticks. I plugged last night and fuck that. I\'m going to have to not use tomorrow, or the next day, due to homework. Honestly? I\'m not really confident in myself this time. I can\'t allow myself to get addicted, and I won\'t, I refuse to (everyone said ever :\\), but it\'s shaping up to be problematic in terms of getting actual work done instead of staying up all night high as fuck. Like I am right now. \n\nAnyway, I just rambled a fucking lot. Sorry for the wall of text. '"

As I swung into the rite-aid, I barely noticed a car that was exiting the parking lot at the same time as I was entering. It was a fucking cop. I came so very close to ramming right into him head-on.\n\nI came to a complete stop just feet away from his front end and...\n**PRO-TIP:** IMMEDIATELY reached for the bag of blow, and the few balloons of tar that are ALWAYS kept in my center console (yes, out in the open in plain sight) but always within arms reach and very easily accessible. I took a swig of a bottle of water that is also always opened and in my cup holder. \nThe pro-tip point being here that, unless you\'re transporting serious weight, you should ALWAYS have your drugs OUTSIDE of your pocket, your sock, glove-box, under your seat, your shoe or whatever spot you thought was just so clever that a trained police officer would never be able to find it. HAHA. Some stories I hear of people getting busted and catching felonies over possession of small personal amounts of dope are just unbelievable.\nI will never understand how so many people think that their sock or jammed in between their seat is like an ideal hiding spot for your dope. DONT EVER KEEP IT ON YOUR PERSON LIKE THAT!\n\nAnyways, I parked my car in the closest parking space that was near the front of the store and kept a close eye on the cop who had actually turned around, instead of exiting the parking lot, and was approaching me from behind. \nThere was not a doubt in my mind that he was at the very least interested in me. Probably was trying to racial profile me, but I\'m a very healthy and clean cut looking type of junkie. I had a mouth full of water and all the drugs in one hand, ready to be swallowed within .25 seconds had he lit me up....\nBut, for whatever reason, he just passed right on behind me and exited the rite-aid parking lot on the other end.\nI could not believe it. I was able to save my dope and all.\n\nSo now onto some of the more interesting things i guess.\nI\'ve been on a gnarly tar/coke/xanax binge lately, and god damn... it really is something else...\nFirst I swing by my coke dealer\'s place less than 3 miles away. \n$20 gets me .3 of high quality, rocky, snow white blow. I rack up a line before I even hit the road again... but wait! \nA Marlboro 27 is absolutely necessary at this point.\n\nRoll the windows down, crank up the radio and then....\nAhhhhh, that warm, fuzzy, euphoria begins to set in.\nSuddenly, the $500 I have spent this past week on drugs is all well worth it.\nI then reach into my pocket and pull out an assortment of benzos. I usually go with a bar and 2 10mg valium. The timing here is crucial.\nI\'ll be back home within 10 minutes where my BTH awaits. I aim to take the first few hits of tar at the same time as the benzos kick in.\nIf my timing is close enough, I can almost immediately go into a blissful nod for hours. I\'m on cloud 9. I\'m on fucking cloud 9 and I\'m never coming back down.\n\nEDIT:\n\n1) We\'ve all seen plenty of pix of tar and roxies, so i wanted to add this picture of the coke rock I got:\nhttp://imgur.com/RDk4Mgh\n\n2) Explained how I almost hit the cop.\n'"

Back when before Florida had prescription Monitoring programs and still had pill mills. Back when Oxy 30s used to go for $10 each. I believe the time I am talking about was between 06 and 10. I just want to hear what it was like we're pills used even more common back then? I remember when I started I had no idea what I was getting involved in buying 30s for 10-15 dollars each my senior year of hs in 2011. \n\nI just wanted to hear what this time was like for people who were older and got to experience this for a longer time. I only briefly saw them this cheap after I graduated they then seemed to go up 5-10 dollars each year after that. They hit 30 a 30 in the suburbs of Philly about a year or 2 ago. I'm lucky if I can get 280 for 10. Dealers have no reason to do price drops because supply is so fixed. Also I've never seen any other pills than 30s. I've never seen 80s cause once they switched everyone gave up on them I guess. I've never seen any morphone derivatives either, only codeine not sure why. I want to hear stories of the good old days that supply was near limitless because one could go see a different dr almost everyday getting a new script to sell and put on the street. \n\nAlso I am curious about why people did dope during this time? I'm sure it was still cheaper but at least you had consistent product for maybe only slightly more maybe double the price. Versus today I am a herion addict (sniffer non-IV user) and I buy 5 dollar bags that get me as well as doing a 30. I would be willing to pay double for constant product that also doesn't have the stigma of heroin. But paying 6 times the price is insane these days.

(upon saying these words I start to think about blood for some reason. lots of blood. pretty, bright red blood. i always wanted a red living room.)\nhk: gimme the flashlight, i\'ll look.\n\nso, hk has his face and entire right arm in the trash can, looking for this tiny half gram and digging through all the shit he threw away. i point out that there\'s some more of our shit a bit farther down and he moves a pack of cigarettes (empty, obviously: we checked) and eureka!  \n\nhk pulls it out of the trash can. for some reason he hadn\'t tied the bag before putting it wherever the fuck he put it before he THREW AWAY OUR GODDAMNED HEROIN. my heart leapt in my chest. and before i leapt for his lovely throat, i had the presence of mind to ask, ""did we lose much?""\n\n""actually no, it\'s pretty much all there.\n\nCUE [CECILA](https://youtu.be/a5_QV97eYqM?t=1m54s)\n\nJubilation!

Basically, for stuff I can\'t usually get for free, I\'m a gutter snob. If it\'s not the cheapest, most grimy way of doing it, I ain\'t having none of it. My snobbery extends to my drug use as well, however. Now heroin, that\'s a drug with some class. you think of heroin, you think of billie holiday, lou reed, nico, tony bourdain, kurt cobain (this actually almost puts me off of it), kim deal, the cool kids club basically. when you think of meth, you think of that lady with three teeth the color of spring butter, a smoker\'s growl, and a funny limp who works third shift at the waffle house. i never wanted to try it really. i don\'t usually care for uppers, and i have ADD anyway so it doesn\'t do much for me high-wise. i tried a small shot before driving home from the hotel and it was decent. got a good feeling, everything was sort of...wobbly for a few seconds, and then brighter and more colorful. nice. i\'ll try a bigger one next time.\n\nso, once at home after all the shit with the discarded heroin (jesus christ /u/heroinking, i think you just abdicated your throne) we settle in and i do a good sized shot (for me, i\'m a small guy and uppers hit me hard). the difference is amazing. i can smoke it all night and never feel more than a little kinder and more sociable. this was next level shit. i\'ve never been that happy in my goddamn life. and feeling someone touch you is unreal. i can see how people throw their lives away on this shit, too, now. i\'ll never judge another drug user again. unless they just smoke it, that\'s fucking weak.\n\n\n\n'"

With college fees very high this year I've had to take a loan to cover some of it in order to pay in full.\n\nMy studies are very intense so the best I can hope for is a part-time job maybe once a week to repay this loan.\n\nIn short I certainly won't have the cash to fund a pill addiction or any daily drug use for that matter. In fact I'm pretty much broke right now.\n\nHowever, I've snorted H a few times with a friend (since left the country) & each time I ended up heavily nodding out. \n\nI know that a month or 2 from now, if I have a bit of disposable cash I will be looking to get high. Rather than splurge on oxy, I'd rather invest on some H that's gonna last me a lot longer.\n\nMy questions are: 1) how much ought a heroin naive user buy if they wanted the stuff to last them a week.\n\n2) if you're tolerance is low how long might the effects last from a bump, would you get a glow that would last a long while? Is it possible to snort H and get a semi-alert buzz without just nodding out?\n\n3)how small a dose should I start with? Bear in mind I'll likely be buying quality product from the darknet.\n\nFinally, I know lots of you will discourage me from going down this hole but the fact is my heart is set on buying H. \n\nYes I'm not stupid enough to think I can regulate my use or that farther down the line this wont potentially ruin me \n\nI was an addict of some form for the last 2 years or so. Psychologocially i still have those same destructive tendencies.\n\nThe difference then was that I had cash. For as long as I'm in university, even if I want to snort H every day it simply won't be possible with the extortoniate fees & lack of full-time job opportunity.\n\nSo feel free to warn be but if you could answer my questions too I would v much appreciate it.\n\n Many thanks\n\nRobertDupea"""

3mutg9,ObviousReminder,9/29/2015 12:15:17,"b'You guys warned me, yet I still shat on your advice. Thought I was different than anyone else, that arrogance ended with addiction.'","b'2 years ago I posted my very first thread on /r/opiates\n\nIt was a question regarding some 7.5mg percs that I stumbled across. Up until that time, I had never taken an opiate in my life (I was 22 years old then) not even a little script from the hospital for a tooth ache or something, nada. I explained my situation in the thread saying that I just tried my first taste of opiates and how much I fell in love with the high from the very first taste. Back then, I took two 7.5\'s for a whopping total of 15mg (lol) I was literally floored I was so damn high, I thought to myself this is wonderful.\n\nYou guys desperately warned me to quit now while I was ahead. I told you all ""nahh, I can moderate my use, I \'ll just do it once or twice a month as a \'treat\' and no more"" all of you guys kept saying ""EVERYONE SAYS THE SAME THING"" but my dumbass thought I was special and had more willpower than others.. oh how wrong and foolish I was\n\nFF 2 years and here I am on a 80mg/day Oxy habit, while I still haven\'t \'upgraded\' to the needle or even Heroin for that matter, my first thread here and what you guys told and warned me is a constant reminder about how easily it is to tell yourself you\'ll behave and how easily it is to not behave, so I\'m not cocky anymore regarding my willpower, I must always remain vigilant in this game we play. I know that just because I tell myself that I won\'t use H today, doesn\'t mean I won\'t have a needle in my arm a year from now. My humbleness towards opiates has risen drastically.\n\nAnyway, the point of this thread is hopefully reach people who are just beginning to use opiates and maybe have the same attitude I did 2 years ago. You are not special man, the opiates will always win, no matter how careful you are. Moderation does not exist long term with opiates, it truly is all or nothing (granted, you can \'chip\' successfully for a few months, but in the end the dope or pill will always win, you\'ll slowly start treating your \'chipping\' system with less and less respect and eventually fall hard again, it happens to everyone I promise)\n\nIf you\'ve done opiates a couple to a few times, please please please stop right now and never look back. It\'s really important you heed this advice. I know that once Pandora\'s box is opened, it\'s near impossible to close again, but you have an advantage over a lot of people as in you haven\'t developed a full blown addiction, you still have time to quit. Don\'t be like me and say you\'re different, I SAID THE SAME THING AND MEANT IT 100%.\n\nAnyway, enough preaching, just wanted to tell you guys you were right and I was totally wrong.\n\n'"

We have been doing the long distance thing, so I haven't been able to be there all the time with him to help him if he needed it. His family doesn't know, and I'm one of the very few people who have stuck around for him after coming clean to his friends. But I have been completely supportive of him and his decisions. I just made it clear that I didn't want him to lie to me or keep his use from me.\n\nUnfortunately, he has lied constantly to me for this past year. Even though I have witnessed him smoke, gone to pick some up with him, and even separated the heroin into portions to help him wean off, he still chooses to lie to me. \n\nI've caught him in a lie around 6-7 times now, and we've had the same conversation each time. I explain to him that I love him even with his addiction, but I don't want to be lied to anymore. It has gotten to the point where I don't think I'll ever trust him again. And being in a relationship where there is no trust doesn't seem like a healthy relationship to me.\n\nEven though I was addicted to crack for two years, I, myself, am NOT an opiate user. So I know that I will never be able to fully understand what he's going through each time he decides to get clean. He says that he lies and hides things from me because he doesn't want to disappoint me, but I just wish he understood that he doesn't disappoint me when he relapses. He disappoints me when he hides it from me. \n\nHe told me about his addiction before we started dating, so I knew what I was getting myself into. I just didn't think there'd be so much lying....\n\nSo to sum this up, I am asking for advice from the Reddit community. After a whole year, I feel hopeless. I want to know where he's coming from. But I just get so frustrated whenever he lies to me. \n\nSeriously, what the hell do I do?!"""

And I think he\'s perverted, in a bad way.\n\nA close girl friend is picking the skin off her face next to a newer guy friend. He was really good looking, almost gorgeous 7 or 8 weeks ago. I wouldn\'t get with him if he killed the lights today. He had a nice chest with a 6 pack, and a slim but muscular build. Now he looks like he needs to be checked for muscular distrophy.\n\nI took a guys... Gay virginity the other night, with his wife. We got spun (I try not to shoot it lately), and his wife wanted to put makeup on me, and do my hair. The rest was a Friday night for me.. Pandora\'s box for them. I got dirty texts and had phone sex the next night. He apologized and asked if he\'s gay now the next. It just occurred to me, that his wife probably has no idea about the phone sex. I may be wrong on that, but it would explain excessive, unnecessary apologies on his part. I don\'t want to ask her..\n\nMy main meth dealer (I bought 1-3 points of meth a week, literally) is facing 36 years. He slept with a dudes girl, allegedly dude stole a truck and parked it in his driveway knowing he had reupped while spun out. He beat the fuck out of his literally 90lb toothless 22 year old diabetic girlfriend, who has some kind of chronic pneumonia. Some random chick caught him doing it, she literally knocked his teeth out in broad daylight. Cops let her split, him and his girl went to jail for spitting blood on cops. Except they didn\'t want to provide her medical care, she didn\'t even have insulin. They dropped her off at the ER. While bruised swollen and broke. Literally, it almost sounds nice except they were avoiding liability and medical costs. She bailed her boyfriend out the next day.\n\nLife is ugly on this side. I get perverted and sleep with too many different partners on it. Haven\'t heard I\'m ugly doing that though. I only regret one encounter. Have always used condoms, enjoyed myself, others enjoy it, and haven\'t knowingly helped anyone cheat.. \n\nBut they don\'t see the scars on their faces..\n\nThis is last week. I\'m pretty desensitized to this shit. At 16 I had my life threatened by my best friend suffering meth psychosis. It was at his 30+ y/o dealer/cooks house. A classmate was bound naked on his coffee table. I had tried meth two or three times by then. I recently found out my friends little sister was sleeping with him and his wife, after they shot her up with it. She was 14 then, we were flirting back and forth in school.. I was a kid, she was almost broken by then. \n\nShe\'s been clean the first full year since, as of a momth ago. She never even asked for that life. She watched everyone else doing it as she grew up. She quit to save her kids the same fate. She struggled at first, but she got the hang of it quick, completely on her own. She fucking loves her kids, she\'s terrified of giving them the life she lived. The moment she heard foster care her life turned around. Thats some rare beauty to behold in this world, she worries daily about going back. She will scarcely say hi to me today. I\'m proud of her for that.\n\nFuck meth so much. I left this world behind for six years. I didn\'t miss one night of mindless drivel. No idea what brought me back, but I know I\'m here. I\'m somewhat vain, it scares me to see this shit..'"

I have recently acquired some U-47700, and even after skipping a day or so (longest I could skip would be 48-72 hours over the weekend), I am wondering if my tolerance and the potential for methadone to block the feeling of other opiates/opioids will prevent me from feeling it?\n\nI plan on trying the u-47700 by IV - but only if I think I can do a dose that will allow me to see what this substance is all about.  Any info on maximum solubility of U-47700 in water would also be very useful for my research.  \n\nOverall, I would like to hear experiences from people on MMT (at any dose, higher or lower than mine) w/ U-47700.

Went out to eat with a friend, and had the cops called on us by the pizza lady'","b'[Just posted this in /r/drugs, figured I should post it here too.]  \n\nToday a friend asked if I could give him a ride. I said sure because I had nothing planned. Turns out he wanted to go down to his dealer so he could buy heroin. I thought he was just buying pills, I didn\'t find out it was dope until we were on our way back.  \n\nSo after he buy it we head back to our town, but we were hungry so we decided to stop by a pizza place and get food. Before we went in he gave me a little line to snort. This was my first time doing heroin by the way...    \n\nWe go in and order, I then go to the bathroom to take a piss. By this time I start to feel it kick in. I went to our table, then my friend asked for the car keys so he could get something. Turns out he went back to the car to snort more.  \n\nHe had way more than me, and it\'s quite obvious that he\'s on something. And when I say ""on something"" I mean he was FUCKED UP. His eyes were rolling back and he would randomly just freeze up. I\'m keeping it on the low though. I told him to chill out a bit because he was drawing too much attention to us. He kind of just shrugged it off and continued. By this time I\'m still feeling it. It feels amazing by the way. We\'re eating then about 20 mins in I see two cops outside and the lady who was at the register talking to them. I told my friend and he was like ""So what, we\'re not doing anything wrong that they know of"". He seemed not to care too much, but I could tell he got slightly nervous. I then just told myself it was probably nothing..     \n\nAbout 10 minutes pass and I don\'t see them out there anymore. We pay for the food, leave a tip, and before we left I walked up to the register lady and asked for one of those take out cups so I could bring my soda with me. The lady was like ""Oh yeah, sure"". I thought the tone of her voice was very odd. The other waitress then gave it to me then we were on our way.  \n\nAs we walk out the doors I see two squad cars parked on the other side of the parking lot. I tell my friend, he was like   \n\n""So what, they park there all the time. relax."". Again, he\'s trying to play it cool, but I can tell he\'s nervous. I didn\'t want to get in the car right away and I\'m sure he didn\'t want to either because we knew as soon as we did that the sirens would have went on and there would be a squad car right behind us.  \n\nSo we walked around the parking lot smoking cigarettes and talking. About 20 minutes pass then I guess the two cops got tired of waiting for us to get into the car because the two squad cars start to move. I tell my friend this, and at this point i\'m thinking ""fuck"". I\'m facing towards the lot, he\'s facing towards the store. He asks if they\'re coming our way and I\'m like ""Yup"". By that time we knew what was coming. Game over. They pull right in front of us and the lady cop says:   \n\n""Ok what\'s up guys? You\'ve been walking around the lot for awhile now""   \n\nMy friend then said we were just smoking cigarettes because we didn\'t want to smoke in the car ..and let me add that my friend pulled it together real quick. It was like he was a completely different person.   \n\nThe lady officer said ""Well you were making quite a lot of noise in there""  \n\nAfter she said that I said ""We were just enjoying ourselves"" ..The lady officer then turns her head towards the other to cop and I guess she told him to leave. He pulls away and now it\'s just the lady officer and us. She never got out of the car and we stayed on the sidewalk facing the driver side window.  \n\nThe lady cop, whose name was Angel by the way, ends up talking to us for about an hour. I can\'t even remember everything said, but I actually opened up the voice recording app on my phone 10 mins into this ""conversation"" we were having. I might upload it so you can hear and just censor the personal parts. Probably won\'t though.  \n\nShe was mostly talking to my friend, who by the way is older than me. I\'m 20, he\'s 29. Essentially all we talked about was my friend. She was basically saying how much of a loser my friend was and how he had to get his shit together. They talked about his ex girlfriend, his daughter, his ex\'s new husband, she told him he has to move on with life, he\'s saying shes right but it\'s hard, etc etc.  \n\nShe finally leaves. When she was out of sight we just sigh of relief. We couldn\'t believe what just happened and how lucky we got.  \n\n\nShe never searched us and never asked for any ID which was VERY fortunate because I only have a permit, not a divers license and my friends license was suspended for a year and a half because of his DUI. Plus, he\'s on probation, he had heroin on him, and he had a vape in my car.  \n\nI would have just gotten a fine or something, he would have been locked up for sure.  \n\nI\'m still in shock, and don\'t know how we pulled this off. All I can say is holy shit.  \n\n**TL;DR:** My friend and I are stupid as fuck but we got lucky this time.\n'"

3mrv03,ineedhimtobeok,9/28/2015 19:51:48,b'Boyfriend of 6.5 years overdosed on heroin yesterday and is in the ICU in critical condition',"b'The person I love more than anything in the world is currently in the ICU due to a heroin overdose.  I had no fucking clue he was using again.  The worst part? We live together. \n\nHere\'s the story:\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been together since high school.  He\'s my best friend. We were perfect together in my eyes. My boyfriend was first introduced to ""cocaine"" in either April or May of 2014 (can\'t recall the exact month).  His ""friend"" asked him to do ""cocaine"" with him.  He began sniffing and was instantly hooked on this shit.  Everyone in his family knew except for his mother.  We all thought he had it under control because he is the most convincing person in the world. He\'s extremely intelligent.  He was applying to medical schools which was a very stressful process for him and he was using to cope with it.  He was accepted to an out of state school in August 2014 and we moved away from our hometown and his dealer.  \n\nI finished graduate school and quickly found a good job in our new state.  I love my job. I do have a commute (I usually leave around 7:30-7:45am and return home around 5:30 if there is no traffic). In September 2014, he went away on a trip with his mother and ended up having to tell her about his ""cocaine"" addiction.  The w/d he experienced could not have been anything other than opiates.  She kept him there for a week until he got through the w/d and then he returned home to me.  He was the man I fell in love with again.  His eyes didn\'t look empty. He looked healthy.  \n\nTo my knowledge, he was clean aside from one ""slip up"" in October 2014.  I gave him an ultimatum: me or heroin. I fucking regret this more than anything. He\'s said to family members and myself that he would commit suicide without me, that he\'d have no reason to live. He said he chose me.  I never found any evidence that he was using. No cut up straws, no empty stamp bags- nothing. \n\nMedical school was difficult for him.  He ended up failing two courses and being dismissed from the school.  He was lost.  He fell into a depression.  I did everything I could to help him through this.  He said he was fine.  He said he wouldn\'t turn to heroin and would pull himself out of this on his own.  He appeared to have done so last month (August 2015) as he was researching graduate schools and preparing to send out applications. We don\'t care what career he pursues, as long as he pursues something- something that he is passionate about and interested in. He seemed to be happy again.  \n\nFast forward to yesterday, we\'re on our way back from our hometown where we were visiting family.  The night before he stayed at his dads and I at my parents home as I had not seem them in a while. He has not been sleeping well and tells me he would like to sleep in the back seat during the drive back home.  Sure, makes sense to me. He\'s sitting in the seat directly behind me. I\'m driving and listening to music when I hear him make this gasping noise that I will never forget. I look back and his eyes are hardly open, barely breathing.  I see a syringe on the floor.  WHAT THE FUCK- why would he fucking start this shit again and IV use? Are you kidding me?  I frantically call 911 and begin CPR but hes not responding.  Police arrive after about 4-5 minutes and administer two doses of narcan and take over CPR- nothing. EMT arrive and give him two more doses of narcan- nothing. Goes into cardiac arrest but they shock him and are able to get a pulse.  He was breathing on his own once he arrived to the hospital but they incubated him to be safe.  He\'s now in the ICU in critical, but stable, condition.  His vitals look good- responsive to pain, his pupils dilate, he squeezes my hand when I ask him to, and the nurse says he opened his eyes this morning but hasn\'t since.  We won\'t know if there\'s brain damage until he\'s fully awake but his eeg looks good so far.  \n\nHe\'s probably going to be sedated for the next few days because he\'s been experiencing some cardiac arrhythmia. He will have an ekg done- hopefully tomorrow.  How did we get here?  How did I not see this? I feel so fucking stupid. I watched my best friend die. \n\nHe hid it all from me.  EZpass records show that he was going to another state every other day to score while I was at work.  I have a company car so he was using my ezpass and personal car along with his so his parents would not notice.  He was taking out cash advances on his credit card which is paid by his dad.  It seems like he\'s been doing this since getting dismissed from medical school in June.  He\'s been able to explain away every questionable behavior.  In the hospital the only marks I could see were on his feet and he always wore socks. I found his little kit in his bag which he took to our hometown along with 30 stamps.  It seems like he kept this bag in a secret compartment under the seat of his truck. He needed help and didn\'t come to me because I gave him an ultimatum. I wanted to believe him.  I wanted to trust him.  I love him.  I can\'t do this without him. \n\nNeedless to say, he needs to go to inpatient treatment.   His family and I have talked about the plans- he will not be living in the two states that he associates with his use, that\'s for sure.  He\'s never coming back to the places he\'s used. I want to do whatever I can to help his beat this awful addiction but I know he needs to want it too. His stash which was in his little kit has been flushed.  I am going to move with him to whatever state everyone decides on after rehab and we\'ll go from there.  I need him. He needs me. He will get through this but I know there\'s a long road ahead. I need him to wake up.  I keep wondering if I\'m going to run out of tears.  Every time I close my eyes, all I see is him unconscious in the back of my car.  I hear him gasping for air.  He wanted to go alone this weekend to visit family.  He would be dead. I almost lost him. I guess I did lose him for a few seconds.  \n\nHe\'s been the best part of my life for the past six and a half years.  He\'s wonderful a person. He was vulnerable, turned to the wrong place and got stuck there for a while.  He\'s his worst critic. He sets standards for himself that are impossible to reach.  He\'s so unbelievably remarkably intelligent. He\'s already accomplished so much in his life and he\'s full of potential but he can\'t see it.  He thinks he\'s a failure.  I wish I could make him see himself though my eyes. \n\nPlease, please wake up.  I forgive you.  I understand.  I need you to get better.  You promised we\'d grow old together and we\'re going to.  I can\'t go on without you.  I won\'t go on without you. \n\nTLDR: I\'m a fucking idiot '"

I also suffer from SEVERE anxiety and panic attacks ... Like there\'s always a general anxiety with me and once or twice a week I get ""THE BIG ONE"" literally feel like I\'m going to die ""THIS TIME IT\'S DIFFERENT""...\nAnywho last night I was drinking and took my normal dose of blues ... Maybe one extra. Also I really didn\'t hit the drinking that hard. I normally drink until I\'m ready to pass out,eat a little something and go to sleep. Well, last night I stopped drinking a few hours before going to bed and instead was drinking water ... Like a lot of it... Like 8 water bottles,Idk why I was so thirsty. I then ate like 3 slices of pizza and was completely stuffed, to the point it felt uncomfortable. I don\'t shit as much as I used to on these things and as a result I have gained a lot of weight and my stomach always feels weirdly full... Last night was the most I\'d ever felt it like that. So I of course I have a panic attack. Worried a it my heart rate,the fact that I\'m nauseous, I suddenly start to equate my wanting to throw up with me having a ""heart attack""... (I had see in movies people throw up before having a heart attack... I think) So I don\'t throw up. Instead I eventually calm myself down and make my way to my room upstairs and go to sleep shortly after. I suddenly wake up because I feel liquid coming out of my nose ... IT WAS VOMIT ... It was in my mouth too! Thing is I didn\'t throw up on the bed and I didn\'t have to throw up after it was just ... Like an ""acid burp"". I ended up going right back to sleep and figured ""fuck it if it\'s going to happen again and I choke then I guess that\'s how it was meant to be ..."" I was sooo tired after that whole ordeal but the truth is I was scared shitless as I had never experienced anything like that. I\'ve been scared as all hell today and being the junky alcoholic I am I still want to drink and watch MNF... \n\nHere\'s what\'s tripping me out though... I probably drank waaaaaaaayyyy  more than that on 1000\'s of nights and 7 30\'s isn\'t nowhere near the most I\'ve ever done ... And I\'ve ways been ok. Could I have died? Would my body have woke me up regardless seeing how I hadn\'t dosed or drank in like 7 hours at that point... Idk I know you\'re all going to tell me to see a doc. But the truth is I won\'t go anyways ... So what do you think? Any input would be appreciated. '"

This is me at my worst. \nI've known about loperamide. Just always figured it alleviated every physical symptom except RLS. How could anything rid of such an evil nasty thing?\nI went to wal mart and bought almost 100 for $7 or so. They were the knockoff Equate brand, 2mg gel caps. \nAte about 120mg throughout the night.

But I had no tingly sensation making me want to rip off my skin or pace around my house or jerk my dick off til it was raw or hit and burn myself or put a bullet in between my eyes! Whenever I would start to feel it coming on, I would eat 6-10 more. Smoked a shit ton of weed after swallowing them. And I was actually able to lay in bed without tossing and turning. Amazing. \nLike I said, the RLS is the worst symptom for me. I would say loperamide alleviated 90% of my WDs. Funny tho, I took a shit 4 hours after eating 40mg.

See you tomorrow...\nLove,\nM2K\n\nThe alarm screams at me from the Darkness.  Alone with the dopesick beast gnawing on my nightmare.  A pale thing with holes and bruises.  Propped up nude, I look like scarecrow corpse with madman eyes.  \n\nAnd my god follows me.  Every moment of my waking life he whispers:  \n\n""You need me child.  I will give you the pleasures of the Gods.  Walk with the Night.  Know my Love.""\n\nThe first thing I do every morning is decide whether to shit or puke.  I keep a bucket by the toilet for moments when I can\'t decide.  One less dose has released the opiate binders in my intestines.  Emptying my guts from both ends always leaves me shaky as I prepare for work.  \n\nPut on the Mask.  Pray the glue in the cracks holds for one more day.\n\nI start the shower.  Purify the filth, cloak the death scent with soap.  Put on a happy face!  Only one bottle of shampoo in the shower.  I smile remembering things like Japanese Oatmeal Facial Scrub or Papaya Restoration Conditioner for Colored Hair...A woman\'s touch.  \n\nIt has been six years since I lived with a woman.\n\n****\n\nThey invited \'just a few people\' over.  People from Kym\'s work, some musician friends of Jason.  No big deal.  But people kept knocking.  Tired of opening the door every few minutes, they finally just left it open.  \n\nAnd they kept coming.  \n\nMy brain is needed for this assignment and so why did I take Ari\'s LSD?  Jesus.  Did I really think it would make things easier?  And there is a storm churning out there...The intensity of merriment is whipping up like a cyclone of beasts.  The humming of drunken voices grows louder.  Last time I went out for a Pepsi and a piss, I watched strangers shuffle in carrying twelve packs of beer.  LSD makes me curious, so I stare.\n\n""Oh hey man"" smiles a short skater-looking suburb kid.  ""Like uhm, Kym said there\'s a party here..?""\n\nBehind me is a girl is being held upside down over a keg and sucks beer from the tap.  A crowd counts as her face grows red from gravity.  At 17 seconds, beer foams out her nose and she spews on our carpet.  The crowd cheers.  \n\nI suppose there is a party.  \n\nBack in my room Melo, Dev and three people I have never seen before have infiltrated my academic sanctuary.  The microwave is plugged in on the floor.  A coffee cup whirls within.  \n\n""Hi Lover!"" chirps Dev with wide pupils and an extra happy grin.  ""We\'re making microwave crack.""\n\nI nod.  \n\n""Hello Dev.  Yes.  That seems like a good idea.""\n\n""Dude"" nods Melo.\n\n""Hi!  I\'m Amy!  We met at Rondo\'s"" says a pleasant looking redhead with a pierced nose.  ""This is my boyfriend Jeff and this is Autumn!""\n\nI look at them.  Flannels, boots, piercings.  Autumn wears a black Greek fishermen\'s cap.  Rustic versions of city kids.  Our Northern cousins.  I go back to my desk.  The LSD is starting to pulse through my core.  Though they sit less than four feet away I have not spoken.  I turn to them.  They all look up at me expectantly.  I struggle for something to say but the moment passes.  \n  \nI turn back to my book and hear Dev giggle.\n\nTwo things became apparent.  First, LSD is not a party drug.  Who are these people?  The one named Autumn seems to know me.  She asks about Jason but I got lost in her t-shirt.  A cow with a cigarette wears sunglasses.  It says, \'Cool as fuck.\'  As I ponder this, Autumn pulls her flannel close.  I realize I\'m staring at her chest.  \n\nMayan hieroglyphics spiral down from the ceiling on gossamer threads and it hits me like religion a moment before a violent death.  I am Enlightened.  I am the Chronicler on this night of drunkards and freebasing microwave crack smoking fiends...Then something smashes into the hallway causing peals of familiar laughter.\n\nOh yeah.  The second thing.  The second truth is Kym is wildly out of control.  \n\n***\nAt work, no one likes me.  I am cloaked in a Serious Man disguise.  A humorless, office drone.  I will not high five you or accept your celebrity porn.  Years ago they stopped asking me to get drinks, meet their children or hang out after work.  Now they leave me alone.\n\nI survive here by being high.  My 10am oxy and cocaine bullet in the bathroom keeps me even.  Oh and the 3pm one.  Sometimes the emergency 11am one too.  But as I withdrawal, my humorless side becomes palatable.  I fucking hate this place.  I fucking hate these assholes.  My mask slips a lot due to the extreme physical distress of opiate withdrawal.  I catch myself frowning a lot behind the cracks of my Mask.  \n\nI stare at the spreadsheet that shows how to bleed a third world nation we operate a lawless enterprise in.  In column D are human beings far across the sea.  In my withdrawal pain I consign them to flames without further thought.  As cruelly calculated by Accounting, we just saved 1.4%.  \n\nI am one of ten thousand slimy tentacles writhing on a dark beast miles below the Earth\'s crust.\n\nTime passes slowly here.  I open another spreadsheet and wait to die.  It\'s almost lunchtime.  But no one will ask me to lunch.\n\n******\n\nWhen I hear Motley Crue\'s \'Kickstart My Heart\' cranked up ridiculously loud I know Kym found the coke.  This song is a warning.\n\n""Uh oh Kym found the coke"" cautions Melo looking up like he can sense a shift in the weather.\n\nDev rises from the circle of freebasing crack smokers.  Then she points at me and says, ""By the pricking of my thumbs!  Something wicked this way comes!""\n\nBOOM! The door explodes open pouring the drunken roar of the party and Motley Crue inside.  Kym puts a finger to her lollipop purple lips and goes, ""Shhhh!  He\'s studying!""  \n\nThen she laughs and stumbles inside.  Her followers peek into the room to see Kym\'s mysterious boyfriend.  Hunched over a pile of books with my mouth hanging open at Dev, I do not impress.  Kym stands there with one hand on her hip looking at me like I\'m boring.    \n\n""Whas the fucks wrong with you?"" slurs Kym as more random people pile in like lemmings.  ""Frying again?""\n\nI smile.  I can hide tripping sometimes but not now.  Windowpane LSD is like walking around inside a cartoon.  Everyone is staring at me.  I\'m an alien.  \n\nKym grabs my shirt and kisses me deeply fusing my dream world to her sexuality...I hear Dev explaining that we are her TV.  I wonder what that means...Kym slides into my lap.  Study time is over.  Smeared rainbows trail from her silver jewelry as she coke jabbers at me.  Water flows from the walls and stars twinkle in my peripheral vision.  \n\nTonight she wears black.  Tight black jeans, a Nirvana crop-shirt, black boots and dyed black hair coiled into two horns atop her head...I stare at the madness of her screaming blue eyes as she gossips about Jason.  Then she tilts her head like a bored predator deciding to end it now or have more fun?  She licks her lips and looks at me slyly.\n\n""Do some coke with me babe.  Do it off my neck"" she smiles leaning back.  \n\nI inhale her scent and the cocaine.  I lick her skin and drown in the ecstasy of her delights.\n\n****\n\nI\'m choking on this damn day.  As I lick an envelope I gag and burp up bile.  Sweating and panting I hold onto my desk and fight the urge.  Calmly, I swallow it,  Not a great start to lunch.  \n\nI crawl into my car.  I have a view of the some trash strewn across a hillside.  I set my phone to wake me in 30 minutes.  The morphine withdrawal makes me pass out almost instantly but I wake up ill.  Groaning, I open my car door and puke.  I open a Sprite, drink half and pour the rest over my puke and pass out again.\n\nWhen I wake up, I take an oxy.  Sorry taper.   Not sticking with my plan.  But since I\'m starved, dehydrated and dying, I get a nice buzz.  I almost feel normal when I walk back in.  The manager that accuses me of stalling projects (100% true) sees me and nods.  I nod back.  Earlier I would have scowled.  Chalk one up for prescription drug abuse.  \n\nI crawl through my day.  The pill buzz is brief.  The last two hours pass like gut wound murder.  But I\'m watched.  I work the full 8 hours to justify my keep.  As I leave, no one speaks.\n\nMy heart has been beating wrong.  Like a caged fish flopping in my bones.  I gasp, swoon and keep moving.  Outside the sun burns so hot I could just lay down on the asphalt and die.\n\n****\n\n""Kiiickstaaart myyyy heeeaaaaarttt"" groans Kym dramatically as the song ends.  Loud bass music begins and the walls vibrate as Kym drops to the floor giggling.\n\nI stand up to get my smokes when she suddenly grabs my leg and pulls me to the floor.  People yank up their drinks and scatter as she roars and tries to pin me.  When she bites my chest I yell and kick over the bong.  She straddles me so I grab the coke, yank her shirt down and do a bump off her chest.  She laughs, grabs my head and sways rhythmically to the Geto Boys.  \n\nShe snorts bumps off my stomach and licks me as I stare at the gossamer stalagmites that drip crystal butterflies over me.  Kym\'s head whips up in a deranged cocaine glow as she howls maniacally.  Her eyes are peeled wide open like twin, exploding stars.  I reach to stroke her face but she jumps up.\n\n""Shots!  Let\'s do some whiskey shots babe!""\n\nKym drags me out as more people stumble in to freebase Dev\'s microwave crack.  Our house is packed.  I feel otherworldly weird weaving through the crowd.  \n\n""Bye-bye Lover!"" yells Dev as I trail my love star into the storm.  \n\nI am instantly surrounded by people and every single one of them is smiling.  \n\n****\n\nI spend my days alone.  At work I am surrounded by people I loathe.  I live in a crowded apartment complex with hundreds of people I don\'t know.  \n\nDriving home, it hits me.  I\'m starving.  I pull into a Taco Bell.  The young, black girl that serves me smiles professionally.  Like a lonely freak, I take her smile back to my table to ponder.  So few smiles in my life.  I wonder what it would be like to hold her dark skin in my pale arms?  I actually feel lust.  My penis still works.  \n \nI enter traffic and crawl down the El Camino past the stores that all look the same.  So many people here.  All dressed blandly in khaki, casual office wear.  And I look like every other motherfucker.  But appearances can be deceiving.  My track marks, black bags under my eyes and the 1000 yard stare show I am the weakest creature in the herd.  The one that will be picked off first by wolves.  But no one cares.  No one notices.    \n\nIf I didn\'t get haircuts or go to the doctor I could avoid human contact for years in this strip mall town.\n \n***\n\n""There he is!"" yells Jason who lunges through a throng of people to grab my hand and hug me.  Bear crushing hugs are his specialty and he lifts me off the ground like we haven\'t seen each other for months.  We actually ate dinner at Tacos El Unico when I dropped the acid.\n\nIt is a lovely thing being young and stupid.  There are over a 100 people in a two bedroom flat.  I sense the storm is raging slightly out of control but who cares?  It all swirls together in a melting loop of cartoon madness as I tether my brain to three anchors for sanity.  \n\nMy first anchor is Dev.  She tells me everything is alright.  I love Dev and believe anything she says when I\'m dosed.  Tonight everything is gonna be alright.\n\nJason is another one.  He circulates and makes everyone feel awesome.  Three random Mexican guys that can\'t speak English followed the noise from the street into our house and Jason gave them beer.  That is so Jason.  Plus I bet he dropped at least $200-$300 bucks on the booze and pizzas that keep appearing as the night rolls on.  \n\nMy last anchor is Kym.  She is dancing which is witchcraft when you are that beautiful.  Her spell releases people from their lives so they are free.  In my LSD eye I watch her transform them to music.  No sense of self as they descend into her madness and follow the Maenad.  Howling and crazed they move like the world is burning.  Men and women surround her but I barely feel jealousy anymore.  They are part of her world.  Playthings.  She weaves through them laughing.  \n\nPlus Kym publicly claims me with sloppy, overtly sexual displays of affection.  These embarrass the hell out of me but make me realize I am one her anchors.  A tether back to the world that lets her freely turn from flesh to energy without worrying about repercussion.  \n\nShe knows I will catch her.\n\n****\n\nEnd of the day.  My present to myself for going to work is heroin.  A foil bead tribute to the Dragon god.  I need to jump off the smack.  I need to get more pills but they are so light and feathery in their touch.  A flirting sensation that flees quickly from my weary mind...With fire I chase the Dragon across the silvery plain.\n\nAs I hold in the smoke I can hear my neighbors.  They exercise after work, eat at meal times and rear two small children.  They have goals and dreams and go places on the weekends.  \n\nFuck them.\n\nI am alone.  Peanut butter toast is dinner and I\'m counting pills for my evening taper.  I put them in a bag and lock the bottle in a safe.  TV bores me.  Too twitchy to read as the Dragon leaves the room.  He is winding through the furniture and slips through the window.  He takes my message to the Flower God.  \n\nI miss you.\n\n*****\n\nJason has his arm around that girl Autumn.  Kym is messing with the stereo.  Dev materializes in front of me.  She is so tiny.  Without a word she suddenly hugs me fiercely.  I freeze as I am not a hugger.  But I melt into her small embrace.  I can feel her energy and it feels good.  She releases me and smiles.\n\n""For your next life"" Dev says as loud jangly guitar sounds fill the room.\n\nEveryone here knows this song.  My roommates play it over and over and it fills them with energy to get crazier and crazier.  With his arm still around Autumn Jason spits beer into the air and drags her into the room while yelling along with the song, ""That\'s the way it GOES!  This city is so COLD!""\n\nAnd people start howling along and jumping up and down while screaming the chorus, ""Baby I\'m born to loooose!""  \n\nI can feel the old house shaking under the dreadful stomp of hundreds of boots.  It feels like they could bring it down as they howl and scream along to the song.  And fuck, it\'s good be alive.\n\n**********\n\nI wake up at my dining room table.  Seven empty beer bottles and half empty pint of Jack Daniels greet me.  I look at the clock.  Only 9:20pm.  Shit.  So many more hours until my alarm.  I feel like I\'m gonna be sick so I check what\'s left in my taper bag.  Empty.  \n\nGone.  Like me.  I don\'t feel high.  I just feel like I can puke.  The doctor said I\'d die if I keep this up.\n\nI wonder when?\n '"

3mq3sl,davidtoni,9/28/2015 12:39:37,b'Doctor Question for my r/bros!',"b'Hey there friends,\n\nWell, very soon I have a doctor\'s appointment. It\'s my first time seeing this guy. A few of my friends have this guy and get HUGE scripts (yeah, I think that he\'s a croaker) but I digress... Anyhow, their scripts are for, say, 90 percs, 120 Adderall 30s, and 60 Xanax bars. That\'s a ""typical"" script. I have a friend who sees him also who gets her 8/2 bupes from him, 60mg Adderall/dy, and 60 1mg Xanax.\n\nHere\'s the thing: I have been on 3mg of Xanax per day for almost 15 years now. It has been both licitly and illicitly obtained. The last prescription that I had for it (3mgs) was about 3 years ago. Since then, I\'ve been getting them from the DNMs.\n\nI am also on methadone, 80mg/day. This is through a clinic and is legit. I have 2x/mo carries as I always piss clean (they don\'t test for THC nor benzos). In fact, the CLINIC were the ones that got me addicted to the Xanax in the first place! They had me on 100mg/dy, 6mgs Xanax/dy, AND 60mg diazepam/dy. Yeah, I know, I played them--but still, that could have killed me! Never came close though.\n\nIn the by and by, the doc that wrote for the benzos resigned and they ""tapered"" me off. At three mgs I saw a shrink, DID NOT mention the methadone, and got a script for 3mg/day (and Cymbalta, which, of course, didn\'t get filled). This dude died, hence I started acquiring them illicitly.\n\nOK, if you were me what would YOU say to a doctor that, if he\'s not TOTALLY freaked as it is, WILL most likely write? I am NOT interested in opis as the \'done holds me just fine. Only the Xanax. I DO want to quit the shit someday though!\n\nWhat do you think I should say? Where to start? Should I mention that I was looking into the Ashton Method (sloooowly moving over to diazepam and tapering from that over 2-3 years) and ask him if he\'ll help me end the Xanax by tapering me according to the Ashton Method?\n\nKeep in mind that, as I said, I DO want to get off of the Xanax!! I just know that it\'s going to take a LOOONG time, and I WON\'T cheat.\n\nShould I even mention the methadone?? This guy does NOT test.\n\nHow would you handle this pickle my fellow friends?\n\nI REALLY appreciate your advice--anything you can help with is VERY appreciated!\n\nPS--Just wondering, anyone ever try clonazolam? It just popped up on my screen and I\'m not gonna get any--just interested! Peace out!'"

3mo8g2,cooldudz,9/28/2015 2:12:45,b'Will I withdraw from oxycodone if I take Kratom tomorrow?',"b""I've been taking oxy starting 4 weeks ago for a frequency of 3 times a week. It started with a 30 mg oxy op, but I got blasted and lowered the dose to 10 mg 2 days later, and used pretty much from 10-15-20mg op doses since then. The past 2 weeks though I've been combing the op's with percs at dosages of 15mg percs and 10 mg oxy op or 20mg oxy and 15 mg percs. And I would dose twice on Friday nights! I'm scared of my past binge  this weekend starting with 15mg percs and 10 mg oxy op followed with 15 mg perc at night time. Saturday I took 20mg oxy op and 15 mg perc but wasn't feeling it enough so redosed 15mg percs 2 hours later. Then today I sucked on an 20mg op oxy(usually soak it in coca cola and that has me high in an hour and peaks at 2) and found out I'll be dry until 2 weeks so I did 15mg more percs another hour and a half later, 30ming after percs I did another 20mg... \n\n\n\n\nSO MY REAL QUESTION IS (TLDR):\nAfraid I might withdraw from oxy tomorrow from 4 weeks of 3 times a week, have some Kratom that I may take. Somehow if I'm not supposed to withdraw from the oxy, WILL TAKING KRATOM TOMOROW GIVE ME OPIATE WITHDRAWALS TUESDAY?? I'm jumping to this assumption cause they work on the same receptors correct? So will taking Kratom Tomorow count as another day towards opiate dependency? Sorry if this is a stupid question :P\n"""
3mo7kf,buhder,9/28/2015 2:02:00,b'Meth really helps with opiate withdrawals',"b""Hi everyone,\n\nToday I wanted to make a post which discusses my experience using meth as a withdrawal remedy. But first some background. Throughout the past week or two I have run out of oxycodone. I decided not to re-up since I spent over $900 on oxy in August alone, and that level of spending is not sustainable with my current budget.\n\nSo instead, I've been going through 2g of Baltimore dope to get off a 60mg per day oxy habit. I decided to do this because I have plenty of suboxone (50mg+) and felt that I would be able to manage the withdrawals when I inevitably ran out of dope. I was snorting about 50-100mg of dope each day, which isn't much at all compared to people who shoot .1 every 8 hours or so, but it's still a habit. I usually snort 20-30mg 3 times a day. Regardless, my use was frequent enough such that my body built up a physical dependence.\n\nFast forward to today: I just snorted the last of my dope this morning. Unfortunately I couldn't get any more today, but I have some coming through for sure tomorrow. It was with this in mind that I decided against inducing with suboxone since I know I won't be able to get high off dope tomorrow. I'm sure people can relate.\n\nIn the morning I took a 10mg valium with my dope, which kept me going until about 6pm, then the withdrawals kicked in. Runny nose, lots of yawning, minor RLS, pain, etc. Most of you probably get it; it's r/opiates, most people here have been through withdrawals many more times than I have and have much bigger habits than me. Anyway, after my withdrawals got bad enough a few hours later, I took half of a soma (175mg carisoprodol) and a few hydroxyzine. It made the muscle pain a lot better and caused me to drift off to sleep, albeit only for an hour.\n\nWhen I woke up an hour later (late at night, around 10pm) I realized I had something to do before midnight. Since I had read here before that meth helps with opiate withdrawals and I was in the midst of them, I decided to snort ~60mg of some nice crystal. Fuck that burn, but within ***a minute*** my withdrawals were almost completely gone. The only symptom that seemed to remain was my runny nose, but it wasn't as bad as before. It probably had something to do with me snorting the meth instead of smoking or shooting it.\n\n---\n\n\nYes, I wrote this while I was on meth. Obviously. I already feel like I said way too much lol. Anyway I hope everyone is having a good (late) night since it's pretty late where I live here on the east coast. Looking forward to scoring tomorrow soooo badly.\n\nEdit: grammar"""

I also halved my dosage (from 50mg to 25) and here I am twenty minutes post dose about exactly as high as I have been getting with the 50mg for the last few months. \n\nI know this is not definitive; I'd have to do more stringent testing to know for sure if the grapefruit is not helping but I suspect that if I do that testing I'll discover that the grapefruit is actually inhibiting the high to a degree. \n\nIs that possible?

For every twenty dollars you spend, how much is it profit for you connect compared to covering expensive.\n\nA kilo is 1000 grams (it's is easy to remember). If one kilo = 40,000 (saw this number thrown about on another thread), then a gram should be about 40 bucks. So, people buying grams for 60-80 are getting a mark up between 50 to 100 percent, more if it's the standard 100 bundle. Now that's if your lucky to buy from someone who gets keys. Say your guy pay 5000 for 100 grams; now 100 bundle is just 100% market up.  You the math.\n\nIt's a whole different game for pills. Market forces are pretty strong in play (if your H is bomb, someone will be willing to pay an extra 20 where as anything over a 1 per mg for blues is highway robbery). Average addition is is about 5 dollars, which is only 20-25% market up, way lowering than dope. It seems like most of the money is going to the person being prescribed the stuff (rightly so, since they are the one going without their meds, have bills, etc) and they know the price of their shit. It seems like pills are just more expensive for everyone across the board. \n\nThoughts? How much is your dboy making off your weekly habit? """

3nxx22,PercoThrowaway,10/8/2015 1:37:54,b'Finally got HIGH tonight + some drug porn',"b'B/r/opiates. I\'m both happy and sad. Happy because I got truly high tonight and I wanted to share that with some dope + weed porn with y\'all. Sad, because I wrote an AWESOME post, like 3 nice long coherent paragraphs(with TL;DRs, im not a douche), and I nodded off for a second, hand slipped, I woke up startled because wtf, and closed the window. And that was after taking like 45 minutes to write all the shit out in the other post because high. I\'ll try and keep this as short as my high brain that likes to write a lot can, no promises. \n\n**TL;DR** : Sad cause I wrote a perfect post that took me forever cuz high, deleted by accident cuz high\n\nI have a fairly high IV Heroin tolerance. I\'ve used opiates on and off for the past 5 years, like 80% on and addicted the past 2-2.5 years. I mostly use BTH but ECP when I go back home to the east coast. **TL;DR** : oh fuck you read it\n\nAnyway, i\'ve used plenty. Got high plenty. But I haven\'t gotten HIGH, like that perfect great amazing high that makes you feel like ""shit, being an addict and spending all this money and going through w/ds would be worth it if every high was like this"". I haven\'t even nodded since January before this. \n\n**TL;DR** : oh fuck you read it\n\nThat changed tonight though. Basically, main dealer A got some new shit in. Stuff is primo. Daaank as fuuuuacckkkk. Solid 8 - 8.5 out of 10 when it comes to black. I tried it twice before, once when I still had sub in my system (nbd, not the best idea,  I knew I wouldn\'t get blasted, but it was only a dub, I felt it enough to be worth it, etc). Second time again was a dub (and .15 the next morning), which was great, much better than Main Dealer A and Main Dealer B\'s normal stuff. Still though, not blasted. The rush made me feel almost there, but didn\'t follow through 100% on the high.\n\n\n**TL;DR** : One of my main dealer got some new shit, went from getting 5.5-7 / 10 shit to 8.5 / 10 shit. Tried a dub, shit was amazing.\n\nI finally was able to cop for real tonight, and I got a half gram (for $50 too, not too bad. I hear people on here talking about paying $80 for a half G of black, that would make me quit!) I dropped .35 on the spoon with the non-alcoholic tap-filtered vodka and shot it up in 2 syringe shots (because im a fucking pleb and have only 1/2 ml syringes, they were free from a friend I met on here, so i\'m not complaining). And holy shit.\n\n\n**TL;DR** : Copped ""for real"" tonight, got .5 , did .35, basically had opiate orgasm. Best high i\'ve had in years.\n\nHeres some minor drug porn. I don\'t really post it ever, but I finally was able to get some solid pics.\n\n**http://imgur.com/a/qnyw5**\n\nFirst pic is just .2 of the black leftover I plan on saving for the AM. Gonna be an amazing morning I know it. Bang that, sit on this comfy ass couch for 15 minutes, get up and make breakfast + coffee. Hrrrnnnggg. Thing behind it is my wallet.\n\nSecond pic is my bowl, Donatello, and the marijuana, torn up by hand because I was too lazy to find my grinder. I also don\'t really care about min/maxing when it comes to marijuana.\n\n\nThird pic is the nug! About 1.2g. Super dense. Not the best picture, but not too bad. I\'m no marijuana pro, but I think that is one damn fine nug. Like damn. Zoom in on that shit. It\'s like crusted with orange hairs. Not just a few of them, but it\'s like a old fat italian chef\'s chest but died orange. The THC crystals are bountiful too, you can see better IRL, but they\'re more ""small and all the fuck over"" than ""big/medium/small and you can see every one bc micron microscope lol"". I think its ""greenhouse"" grown, rather than ""indoors"". It\'s deff not outdoors, or if it is, it\'s gotten like, the uptmose care and the best soil/sun/weather conditions heh.\n\n**TL;DR** : **FUCK YOU READ IT ITS ABOUT POT**\n\nThese pics were  taken by an iPhone 6. This is the first time i\'ve looked at pictures from my phone I put on imgur on my computer and DAMN SON THEY LOOK GOOD AS FUCK. /humblebrag. I\'m still kinda on-edge when it comes to taking pics close up like that because my hands shake a quite bit (for no reason, just whenever. idk maybe I have tremors or early very not-severe parkinsons, hope not. Not caused by nervousness, but I think that makes it worse.) so I can NEVER get them in focus but fuck i\'m happy I did!\n\n\n**TL;DR** : Just talking about my camera and shit, and that i\'m normally trash-level at taking pics, partially because my hands are basically Michael J Fox, besides them lacking talent.\n\n\nSo, any of y\'all get that perfect heavy, strong, amazing high today or recently? How was it? Also, feel free to post your pickups for the morning/day/night. I\'d love to see some BTH from around the states(or world). \n\n\nHave a good day b/r/opiates, b/r/opiettes. To the hustlas, killas, murderers, drug dealas, even the scrippas, junkie jesus walks with them! - Yeezus (kinda)\n\nOh yeah. Be nice to someone on the internet today. Someone that you otherwise were about to be mean to, for whatever reason. A stupid post, them being completely wrong, whatever. Just one person. More if you think you can do it and not want to hurt yourself, lol. Kill them with kindness (and polite, fair sarcasm). One person a day will improve your life. This transfers to real life too, but it\'s a lot easier to be a dickhead online than in person face to face, for most people :)'"

Secondly I have no reason to be addicted as many of you do. I grew up in an upper middle class home. Great parents, not divorced, small town, good school, graduated college etc. I have never been in any toxic situations or dealt with problems like abuse, being poor, or really struggling at all. I dabbled in opiates in college and never was addicted but definatly would do them whenever I could find them, which was maybe once a month. Moved to a new city after graduation and got a good well paying job. Then one day I got the urge to do opiates but obviously being in a new city I couldn't find any. Then I discovered the other opiate sub we use and was introduced to heroin. After that it was an immediate spiral into addiction, needing more and more to keep me satisfied. I'm at a point now where I have spent all my savings and it's probably only a matter of time before my fiancee finds out. I literally hate everything about myself right now. I wish I could think woe is me, I have an addiction, its not my fault but it is. Its 100% my own doing and I have no excuse. Others on this sub have had terrible lives and are masking the pain by doing heroin. As bad as it sounds at least they have a reason for their use where as I don't. That probably feels the worst out of everything. Sorry for the wall of text, I don't really have any reason for this post besides getting it out because all I can do it dwell on it at this point. I have tried stopping but we all know how that is. Sorry if I seemed offensive if you were someone who had a terrible life and use dope to mask the pain, I did not intend it that way. Have a good day, you all are great people and just know that every one of you probably has a better reason for doing dope than me. Bring on the tough love, I need someone to tell me I'm a fucking idiot for doing this to myself."""

(About pricing/insurance)',"b'Hi everyone,\nI\'m on here often but as you can see this is a throwaway for now. Anyway, I wanted to ask two quick questions (the second may have a very long answer depending on peoples\' experiences):\n\n1) How amazing is this shit for getting clean and demolishing cravings? (I realized this wasn\'t really a question but was too lazy to change the above text). Feel free to ""answer"" (or respond/agree/disagree I guess.\n\nThe reason for Q1 above is just to introduce my history with subs, along with future plans. To give some background, I have been hovering around 2-4mgs of subs total daily for probably ~4 months with an occasional break to indulge in other stuff for isolated weekends. The latter ""vacations"" I give myself will need to eventually stop I know, but nevertheless I am very happy with the amount of control I feel subs give back to me (or they give me the strength to fight the rest on my own with support from friends/family/this community).\n\nthis leads to question 2:\n\n2) Given my current plan to continue on low maintenance level sub doses that will stay at or lower than ~4mg total per day maximum, how would you guys recommend I manage my supply of subs? This is *NOT* meant to be a sourcing question; I am really asking a 2-choice question: Sub doctor + some sort of programs, or getting suboxone elsewhere without insurance or having to follow strict rules (which I know could be best for me, but I want to try this as comfortably and slowly as possible as I can; am always happy to try something new if I  feel like what I\'m doing isn\'t working anymore). \n\nSo the question is... how big of a weekly/monthly difference in price (obviously just estimated or based on your experience(s) since things vary so much depending on geography) is there between getting an ""average"" sub doc / monthly prescriptions vs. finding subs myself and paying ~$20 per 8mg strip. I\'m sure this is an insanely high price, but that\'s the only other option I have, and I haven\'t had luck with doctors so far.\n\nPart of the real reason I ask is because I much prefer just paying out of pocket instead of jumping through all the doctor b.s. hoops, but if I\'m paying so much that finding the right doctor could save me an ENORMOUS amount of money, even over the span of a month or two, would be helpful info. \n\nI will keep searching for related threads on this here, but wanted to quickly pump this out before returning to work. Thanks in advance for any advice or suggestions.'"

I plan on getting clean fairly soon, and hopefully staying that way. I\'m sure i\'ll still drink(not a big drinker though), I might smoke some weed here and there, and i\'m sure my friends will still want to go to festivals and stuff like that once or twice a year where i\'ll probably drink/smoke/take acid/MDMA. I mostly mean from opiates(and benzos, don\'t have a benzo problem though).\n\nBut I feel like when i\'m old and retired, or even a few years before retirement, i\'ll want to use again. I know I won\'t be smoking pot/doing acid and mdma when im like 38, but I could see myself doing that stuff again at 55 or 60. \n\nI\'m mostly looking at opiates and benzos though. For one, it may change in our lifetime, but I feel like doctors prescribe opiates and benzos to old people willy nilly, and the ""good stuff"" if you\'ve actually got problems. That, along with most likely having a very solid disposable income means I can enjoy drugs again without much worry. Some heroin while vacationing in London or Paris with a nice 30 year old prostitute sounds nice. Or my wife, if i\'m married and bring her along.\n\nAnyone else feel similar? I know with being older you kinda have to be more careful with doing drugs due to, well our bodies literally dying, but I feel like opiates wouldn\'t be too hard on the body and mind as long as they\'re taken properly. Not to mention, I would never be sick as I would always keep a ""safety stash"" of my meds/some suboxone.'"

She comes back and drops a small baggie with a gray looking substance inside in front of me - heroin. She gets a straw and a plate from the kitchen, empties the contents of the bag and crushes it with her credit card before snorting it all. My heart is crushed with it. She nonchalantly resumes the conversation while I sit there with my mouth wide open. ""So do you use often?,"" I ask while trying to be calm. ""Oh, you know how it is. I\'ve been on and off for years but I\'m quitting again next week!"" I kinda nod and wonder why I even stayed this long. But I feel sorry for her and I decide to question her further. ""How do you afford it?"" ""I\'m an escort now. I usually do an appointment a day and that\'s enough to support my habit."" ""How much is your habit?"" ""About 300 a day."" I change the subject and she puts on a movie while I wonder how the fuck she fell off the wagon like this. I left shortly after the movie.  \n\nI really liked her as a person and we stayed friendly over the years. In your experience, once you\'ve been an on and off addict for years and you hang out with drug dealers, can you ever get clean? I didn\'t judge her, but I told her if she ever needs help getting off that I could help her. She laughed at me and said she knew what she was doing and that she didn\'t need help. She said she tried getting off a week ago by getting on Suboxone (don\'t even know what that is), but that it wasn\'t going to work for her because it essentially replaces one addiction with another. She said she tried quitting cold turkey but that it\'s too painful and she\'s going to wait until her sister is in town to help her with this. It sounded like she was making excuses and telling me things that I wanted to hear. Is there any hope here? Or should I just leave this as is and not stick my nose into other people\'s business?  '"

I had 40 of them left after the pain was over. \n\nMy plan was / is to only take them on weekends.

Many people saying ""I wish I could go back in time and throw those first pills away"". Is there anyone who manages to keep their shit together with lite / recreational / non addictive use?

I\'m an eagle scout with no criminal record and other than talking to people on here I\'ve never known anyone who\'s sold drugs let alone bought them illegally. I\'ve got way too much to lose to engage in illegal activities, especially with people I\'ve never met. I guess my point is even if I get hooked, logistically it\'d be basically impossible for me to get anything without the help of a doctor - but if I somehow managed to get connections I could go off the deep end and blow a shit load of money.

3nrjxp,pstino,10/6/2015 17:19:49,b'2 cold successful cold copping stories and a psa',"b'So, let me start out by saying that this started two weeks ago and that I\'m from Baltimore. This story isn\'t about Baltimore, though. I got a new job in Delaware so I\'ve been commuting up there from where I live like 40 minutes north of Baltimore. It all started when I ran out of rigs. For the previous few days from when this started I had been sniffing my dope and with my tolerance, that just wasn\'t cutting it. I normally buy my rigs off newegg.com, but in an emergency such as this, who has time to wait for shipping. So I tried buying points from a Rite Aid in Maryland and it goes without saying that I was shut down because I don\'t have a script for them. So, it was sniffing my dope me that day. The next day, I looked on Walgreens.com, and they said that in DE I could buy syringes without a prescription and it just so happened that there was walkgreens right by my work. So When I got off, I decided the first thing I would do is go in there and try to buy some points from there. Again, denied because of a lack of prescription which I knew was bullshit because of the website. According to the look that the pharmacy tech gave me though, I knew there was no winning this battle, Now this is where things get interesting. \n\nDue to the copious amounts of time I spend on /r/opiates I knew without a doubt that I would be able to buy them in PA, especially by Philly. So when left the DE walgreens I knew right there it was going to be off to Philly I went. Now, as I got closer I started to think that maybe in addition to rigs I would be able to cop in one of those two neighborhoods that are always mentioned on here. So, I did a search of the sub and got an approximation of where I needed to go. I head up there and park a block away on one of the crossing streets, leaving everything in my car except 80$. I walk to that one street and decide to take a left. I made it about two blocks when a homeless looking dude asked me (from across the street) if I was looking. I went to the crosswalk and met Carlos. My new friend Carlos said he would take me to the spot for 20$. Beings that was in a city that I really didn\'t know anything about I figured that was a pretty fair deal. Something about his toothless grin made me feel like I could trust this guy (lol). So on our walk to the spot, he asks me if I shoot and I tell him ""yes"" he then reaches in his pocket and hands me three rigs individually wrapped in the factory plastic. SCORE! Mission 1 was already accomplished. The rest of the deal went off without a hitch. He got me my six bags I asked him for, not asking for the money until we got right to the spot and I gave him the 20 dollars he asked for. He even walked me back 90% of the way to my car so I\'d feel safe (not that I didn\'t, but it was a nice gesture). When I get back to the car i see that i had six blue bags with the ""Facebook"" stamp. I thought they were pretty good, and it had only been 13 minutes total from the time I parked my car until the time I returned with dope. SUCESS!\n\nSo, a two weeks go by, and in the meantime my main connect had decided he wanted to quit and I had been going through various other sources. I had a guy who gave FAT bags of just mediocre dope. I had a guy that gave SKIMP bags of fire. I had guys who were in between but no one who stepped up as the new number 1. So today I decide to tell my boss I have a ""doctors appointment"" and I decide to give philly another go. \n\nSo I heap up, park in the same spot as before. Use the same ATM, except this time there was this chick sitting on a curb in front of this store nodding her tits off. I tap her on the shoulder and told her that if she can take me to the dope spot I would hook her up. This time, i got 8 bags of ""knockout"" and tipped her a 20$ even though she only asked for 10$. Also again, for whatever reason she asks me if I shoot  and again I say ""yes"". She reaches into a brown paper bag she had been carrying and hand me 5 rigs still in the packaging and says to keep all 5. SCORE. We get the dope and exchange numbers DOUBLE SCORE. Also, Again I was only away from my car for less than 20 minutes. When I finally got around to doing a bag it knocked my dick in the dirt. It was awesome. \nNow, for the PSA: I feel like it is a good possibility that these bags may be cut with fent. I got super high. But it wore off in less than 30 minutes. So maybe fent, maybe not, but I just wanted to let people who cop in that one philly neighborhood to be really careful with the ""knockout"" stamp. \n\nAnyway, hope everyone is well, and having a good night. Be careful out there fam!\n\nTL;DR: cold copped in philly 10/10 would recommend. The second time may have been fent laced. Everyone be careful. '"

3nqjz5,mortalitysequence,10/6/2015 13:20:12,b'Running is the best tool in managing your opiate addiction.',"b'I saw the study today about the neurobiological effects of physical exercise  and I wanted to share my experience with you guys. I started running about 3 months ago when I started reading Charles Duhigg\'s book called The Power of Habit. I started using U47700 about the same time, and running has been the best thing that I have ever done for my health. I started running and rewarding myself with food (going to get a lobster roll, getting Vietnamese food, etc) afterwards. \n\nI continued doing this and I have to say it changed my life more then any other thing. I was using Tianepetine to help motivate me to run, and it helped immensely. I was getting a bit too out of control chipping and after being on suboxone for 6 years and getting off, I didn\'t want to end up with another habit. Mind over matter is huge with this. Before I start running my head is a mess and all I want to do is get high. After the run, I feel good about myself and my life and feel very motivated. So in short, if you need an additional boost in managing your habits, running is the best thing you can do for yourself. \n\n\n""The neurobiological effects of physical exercise are numerous and involve a wide range of interrelated neuropsychological changes. A large body of research in humans has demonstrated that consistent aerobic exercise (e.g., 30 minutes every day) induces persistent beneficial behavioral and neural plasticity as well as healthy alterations in gene expression in the brain; some of these long-term effects include: increased neuron growth, increased neurological activity (c-Fos and BDNF signaling), improved stress coping, enhanced cognitive control over behavior, improved declarative and working memory, and structural and functional improvements in brain structures and pathways associated with cognitive control and memory. The effects of exercise on cognition have important implications for improving academic performance in children and college students, improving adult productivity, preserving cognitive function in old age, preventing or treating certain neurological disorders, and improving overall quality of life.\nPeople who regularly participate in aerobic exercise have greater scores on neuropsychological function and performance tests. Examples of aerobic exercise that produce these changes are running, jogging, brisk walking, swimming, and cycling. Exercise intensity and duration are positively correlated with the release of neurotrophic factors and the magnitude of nearly all forms of exercise-induced behavioral and neural plasticity; consequently, more pronounced improvements in measures of neuropsychological performance are observed in endurance athletes as compared with recreational athletes or sedentary individuals. Aerobic exercise is also a potent long-term antidepressant and a short-term euphoriant; consequently, consistent exercise has also been shown to produce general improvements in mood and self-esteem in all individuals.""\n'"

Is this darkness in you, too? Have you passed through this night?"" *- The Thin Red Line*\n\nThis persecution is too great. We live on the fringe. We live outside society and none of their help ever comes. We are nations, are we not? Our leaders love and provide for us, do they not? That\'s their job, is it not? But we are left alone. We\'re non-citizens in their eyes. We belong to no-one and so it\'s justified to let them kill us, through harm, confinement or neglect. They condemn us to a battery of hardships on top of our own. We cannot keep living like this. Suffering from day to day with the only end being an 8 x 4 box in the ground.\n\nAre we not human? Are we the subhuman dwellers leeching off society? No, we\'re not. We contribute as much as anyone else but our disease, this all encompassing disease of the inability to condemn ourselves to sobriety kicks us back down to the floor. We\'re mud because of a difference in brain chemistry, a difference in socio-economic background, a shitty little difference that should never matter. We cannot get help, we cannot save ourselves so we\'re left to rot. Rot until our final resting place.\n\nA few days ago my friend overdosed and died. I knew her well. We colluded in a heroin habit that I eventually freed myself from. She did not. In her wake she left her child, a tender age of 12. How do our leaders forget about that. They treat the ones who\'ve chosen a separate path like dirt but neglect to think of the impact around them.\n\nSure, you can say it was her fault; she went too far, she didn\'t know her limit, she was irresponsible. Then why condemn an innocent child? Condemn them to foster homes, push them into child prisons with a never ending cycle of de facto homes and social upheaval. \n\nHeroin ruins everything. It takes away your light and life. It takes everything. We know it, they know it and society knows it but is it really our fault? Are we to blame? Are the conditions we live in not applicable when it comes to ""just another overdose""? Will no-one take responsibility?

It\'s golden in color and viscous as hell.\n\nAnd I wanna know if I can shoot it up my butt. First of all, is this even a viable ROA or will I just end up with a rectum full of syrup? And if it is viable, is it a better method of ingestion than taking it orally? I know this is how it works with most drugs, including faster come-up and, sometimes, a higher bioavalability due to lack of metabolism by various organs, but I know that with others it can actually decrease the high as the drug isn\'t broken down into the proper chemicals in vivo. Sooooo thats about it. I might cross-post this to opiates (which I\'ve obviously done...) since this is definitely in their wheelhouse, but drugs is a much bigger sub and I figure I can get an answer more quickly.\n\nOh yeah, and one more question. On a somewhat related note, would Wellbutrin, an NDRI, decrease the high/euphoria I\'d get from the drug (and all opiates for that matter). And if so, how long should I abstain from taking it before my highs will go back to ""normal?"" Thanks ahead of time for any and all help and advice :)\n'"

I can get points for $25 and a half g for $100. Well I had $5 to my name. Well, my good buddy came over to hang out after he got off work. We play cards now which we just randomly started doing a few weeks ago. So him, my brother, and I are playing black jack. Well I quickly had turned my $5 into $50. So I\'m fucking pumped because I had no chance of getting anything and now I have enough for two points. I go to walk away because my brother was out of money and I was happy with my winnings. Then my buddy asks me if I want to play one last hand and put $50 on it. I already had enough to not only fix my sickness but get me high as well so I really didn\'t want to do it but everyone around me peer pressured me into it. So he hands me my first card face down and it was an ace (aces can be high or low). Then my face up card was an ace. So I hit and get an 8. I hit again and get a king. I say ""fuuuuck me"" and everyone starts laughing at me thinking I busted. So he said ""I\'m gonna stay ole bud"". Well we flip our cards over and he had a 13. Since he thought I had busted he didn\'t expect me to have another ace. He was already grabbing the money then I flipped mine and had 20. Then everyone went wild and he said ""you scheming son of a bitch"". I get my dude on the horn and tell him to bring me a half. 30 minutes later I\'m getting high as fuck and enjoying myself. So needless to say I\'m happy as can be right now. Turned $5 and being dope sick with no hope of fixing it to having $100 and buying a half... Not only fixing tonight\'s sickness but getting me fucked up and having some for tomorrow. Thank you guys for reading!'"

3nnmbi,morbo2000,10/5/2015 21:20:23,b'Michael FUCKING Jordan',"b'Basketball.  \n\nFive men try and get a ball into a cylinder ten feet above the ground.  This is a Mayan blood sport handed down to us from forgotten gods.  Humans work together to jostle, smash and shove their way to the hoop as the opposition tries to incapacitate the holder of the ball.  But like any violent conflict, amazing dramas are played out.  \n\nSince dating Kym, I have watched A LOT of basketball.  The Warriors are her team but Michael Jordan is her hero.  To listen to Kym talk about him you would think he is a god that can walk on air.  And she loudly asserts this during The Game.  \n\n""Damn Payton!  Jordan lit you up like you\'re standing still son!"" taunts the obnoxious girl with braided green hair tied in tight knots against her scalp.  ""Fucking peanut-headed motherfucker!""\n\n""Hey Payton\'s from Oakland"" chides Melo.  \n\nMelo loves basketball too.  Kym, Autumn and Melo all used to play basketball in high school.  This game rekindles the aggressive, competitive jock within them.  They actually care who wins.\n\n""East bay!"" says Kym grabbing the bong.  She takes a massive rip and hands it to Autumn.  ""Oaktown represent!  But you\'re still going down!""\n\n""How was that not an offensive foul?"" complains Autumn cracking her gum.\n\n""Haha!"" mocks Kym at the replay which clearly shows Autumn is right but the referees do nothing.  \n\nAutumn stares at Kym through narrow, irked eyes.  She\'s not used to crazy, coked-out, cartoon-flavored Kym.  This is an acquired taste.  \n\n""Wow that\'s gonna be a long plane ride home for the LOSERS"" smirks Kym as she lights a cigarette.  \n\n""Kym I love your nails"" smiles Autumn sweetly as she snaps her gum.  ""My grandma likes that color too.""\n\nKym\'s fingernails and toenails are Chicago Bulls blood red.  Not her usual choice.  Last night when she trailed her hand down my chest I grew fixated on her nails.  They looked so normal sexy.  Like the Playboy magazine women I saw as a kid.  \n\n""Aww thanks"" says Kym suddenly lunging her head at Autumn and stopping an inch away from her face.  Autumns stares back amused.  ""And I love that flannel Autumn.  Hey!  Do they make those for girls?"" \n\n""Heh heh"" chuckles Dev who has been watching Kym and Autumn instead of the game.\n\n""Well I gotta take a shit"" announces Jason.\n\nJason\'s indifferent to the game and brewing animosity between Autumn and Kym.  He grabs one of Kym\'s Cosmopolitan magazines off the table.\n\n""Anyone gotta pee?  Trust me...""\n\nGame 6 of the 1996 NBA Finals.  Chicago Bulls vs Seattle SuperSonics.  Earlier we were at the park watching the Beastie Boy\'s Free Tibet concert.  Kym and Melo insisted leaving after the Red Hot Chili Peppers for The Game.  A lot of beer is going down with bumps of coke.  Kym and I ate some oxy because we ran out of H this morning.  Kym\'s pretending it\'s no big deal but I know she can feel it.  I feel it.  That vortex in my center.  The blackhole sucking in the dragon\'s desire.  So we eat oxy, do bumps and drink.  \n\nDev and Melo met us at the park during Beck.  Kym had a thermos of coffee.  Dev showed up with hardboiled eggs and I bought a thumbnail of hash from a hippie named Detour.  We ate eggs, sipped coffee and zoned out on the 100,000 people wandering our park.  Then Autumn appeared.  \n\n""Saw your stripes"" she said squeezing my arm.  \n\nKym dyed my hair black with thick, red streaks.  I felt her winding up so I whispered: Jason.  Obviously this is a Jason thing.  Autumn has a bag of croissants from Jason\'s bakery.  She hands them out but Kym refuses.  Just stares at Autumn who ignores her.  Great.  I smoke hash with Melo and ignore them both.    \n\nJason starts his shift at 2am.  He works alone and often has friends drop by.  That was me before Kym.  Now his bakery friend is Autumn.  Hanging with Jason while he mixes dough is a drugfest of coke, espresso shots, weed and punk music tapes blasted from a staticky boombox.  No one cares as long as he fills the orders and the first racks are ready by 5am.  \n\nAutumn sits on the couch next to Kym in her black tights, boots, flannel and ugly hat that looks like a crumpled, brown paper bag made of cloth.  Autumn is from Seattle and trash talking with Kym while cracking her gum.  She keeps sucking gum through her teeth making three or four rapid-fire pops.  After an hour of this, I wish she would just smoke cigarettes like the rest of us.\n\n""Oh fuck Jordan!"" groans Autumn as she cracks another string of bubbles.  ""And Pippen?  Horse faced has-been!  Sonics dominated the last two games.  They got momentum.""\n\n""True"" agrees Melo.  ""Last two games were all Sonics.""\n\n""Payton and Kemp are on fire!  This is going 7 games"" assures Autumn as we watch highlights from the series backed by NBC\'s insane, heavy metal music.\n\n""Bitch please"" scoffs Kym.  Autumn whips around annoyed but Kym keeps going.  ""Jordan\'s DUE.  This ends tonight.  He\'s Michael FUCKING Jordan!  Game over!""\n\n""Kemp and Payton-""\n\n""Kemp sucks donkey dick-""\n\n""Hey!"" scolds Melo.  ""Easy.  I can\'t hear the game.""\n\nAutumn and Kym both glare at Melo for a second, harrumph and lean back into the couch in unison just as Jason comes back from the bathroom rubbing his gut.  He plops back on the couch and lets out a huge bear yawn.  As he stretches, Autumn wraps her arms around his neck, snuggles into his chest, looks up and kisses him.  \n\nWell this is a new thing.  These two have definitely gotten together but the public displays just started.  Kym rolls her eyes.  Dev is no longer paying attention and reading something called Grimoire of Honorius.  Melo stares intently at the TV and shouts at some injustice.  Jason looks happy.  His hand slides down Autumn\'s back to her hip.  Then he notices Kym.  \n\n""Jesus!  You look like a Baseball Fury.""\n\n""Yeah got a bat?"" smirks Kym.\n\n""Baseball Furies are silent"" chirps Dev from behind her book.\n\n""Oh fuck off Devika!"" grins Kym snatching my cigarette a moment before it touches my lips. \n\nKym\'s wearing her red, Michael Jordan jersey.  The iconic #23 mixes curiously with black eyeliner smeared across her eyes.  It looks artsy vicious with the spiked collar around her throat, silver bracelets and green hair.  Kym says Dennis Rodman inspired her look.  Rodman\'s the guy on the Bulls with rainbow hair.  He\'s known for being obnoxious and getting under people\'s skin...yeah.  \n\nKym jumps up to yell and I watch her bend over in her tiny, ripped jean shorts.  A Misfit patch sewn on her ass stares back at me.  Then she jumps up and down screaming at the referee.  Her clompy, black boots shake the whole house.\n\n""Oh my god he so FUCKING flopped!"" she complains.  \n  \nCocaine, beer and Kym is loud.  I sigh, light another cigarette and look around.  Only Dev is interesting.  She wears Kym\'s old black cocktail dress.  On Kym it was short and revealing but on Dev it\'s a full length black gown that makes her look elegant and grim.  She sits crosslegged in front of three lit candles that surround a jar.  Dangling in the jar is a piece of string tied to a shell.  She senses me and she looks up.  \n\n""What\'s that?"" I ask.\n\n""I\'m trying to catch ghosts.""\n\nI fake smile and look away.  Yeah that\'s normal.  On TV, a man named Marv Albert paints a dramatic conflict.  His voice and delivery is infectious.  No wonder my friends sit on the edge of their seats screaming like insane people.  \n\n""Dude"" interrupts Jason.\n\nI look at him.  Flour spots cover his Holiday in Cambodia t-shirt.  Jase\'s raccoon eyes are bloodshot from a long night.  I can smell baked bread and cinnamon as he leans over Autumn to speak.    \n\n""The power bill is off"" he says.\n\nI feel one of my eyebrows rising and stop it before Kym notices.  Roommate code.  Come with me and get high.\n\n""Show me"" I say getting up.\n\nIn Jason\'s room we can hear the game heating up.  Autumn shrieks victoriously while Kym and Melo groan.  Someone throws something violently against the wall.\n\n""Fucking Kym"" says Jason shaking his head.  He pours cocaine into the ceramic mortar and pestle I swiped from lab.  He looks at me.\n\n""Oxy?""\n\n""Yeah"" I say fishing some out of my pocket.  Jason crushes them in the bowl.  \n\n""From Autumn"" says Jason holding up a dime bag of crumbly, beige powder.  He hands me my bag and I feel JOY.  The Game, the free concert, my life with my friends are all good things but man...I have been dying for this fucking bag.  The weight is pleasing.  Even with Kym, it\'s two and half days of the perfect life.  \n\n""Powder?"" I ask.  \n\n""Seattle China.  It\'s serious"" says Jason adding some to the bowl.  He grinds it in.  ""So just a little.  For reals dude.  Warn Kym.  This stuff puts me on my ass.""\n\nJase chops out six lines on his Bark at the Moon CD.  The mix of coke, smack and oxy make it look like dirty coke.  We rail three lines each...and my brain is stabbed with icicles as demons grab my body and chain it to the floor.  My ghost HEAVES and I swoon with the tilting room.  I catch myself before I fall over.  Holy shit Jase was right.  The nod approaches...then the coke marches in.  Mixed with oxy it would have been enough but enter the dragon.  And the dragon ROARS.  My limbs are weighed down by surreal gravity as I slow motion walk back to the couch.  Something happened on TV and Kym is doing a crazy dance.  She leaps over the coffee table and high fives Melo who is pumping his fist and yelling like a madman. \n\n""You see that shit?!  Rodman with a no look to Michael FUCKING Jordan!"" yells Kym.\n\nI make my way to the couch and Kym stops shouting and looks at me.  She instantly perceives I\'m wrecked and makes me high five her.  I feel like a fat little kid getting picked on in PE again.  Jason lies at Autumn\'s feet like a dog.  His bloodshot eyes are glistening slits gazing vacantly at the TV.  Autumn stonily stares at the game with her arms crossed across her flannel.  Her team is losing in the other team\'s arena.  The crowd screams for blood.   \n\n""Oh hey babe"" says Kym chugging her beer and belching loudly in my ear.  ""You figure out the-"", and she suddenly slams her elbow into my ribs.  ""-bills?""\n\nIf I hadn\'t anesthetized myself that would have hurt.  After a slight delay, I gasp.  Ow.  \n\n""Ok, ok"" I say sliding her the bag.  ""Just a bump.  Tiny one Kym.  It\'s heavy.  Ok?"" I say looking into sea blue eyes.\n\n""Hmm"" she says weighing my words and scrutinizing my moronic stupor.  She hands the bag back.  ""Then later babe.  I don\'t wanna miss The Game.""\n\nWow.  Basketball is powerful.  I can\'t think of anything I\'d rather do than heroin.  Little moments of self-control like this are like rays of sunshine.  If Kym can do it for basketball, I can do it for something...right?\n\nAnd the Bulls just start to beat the hell out of the Sonics.  Autumn watches in disbelief as her home team unravels.  The end is nigh.  And Kym is a gracious victor.\n\n""Yeah!  Told you girl!"" she points at Autumn while doing a booty dance across the room.  ""But good game.  Do you know what happened Autumn?  Let me explain.  Michael FUCKING Jordan happened!""  \n\nMelo lights a finger fat joint of green bud as the media interviews Michael FUCKING Jordan.  We pass it around and the intensity of our past sins spark up again.  Six beers becomes seven, the cocaine stops numbing our highs and the world crushes in.  Fuck I am starving.\n\n""Let\'s go eat"" I hear myself say softly.  Man I am high.  My meat is on autopilot and it needs food to continue.  Sadly I know if I push the ball forward, gravity will deliver it and I can meekly grab onto Kym and enjoy the ride.\n\n""Hear hear!"" agrees Dev slamming her book shut and blowing out the candles.  ""It\'s Sunday.  $6.50 buffet at Sues.""\n\n""Oh hell yeah"" agrees Kym.  \n\nI love Sues.  An Indian restaurant within walking distance.  Sue treats us like royalty though we stumble in drunk and high like crazed beasts.  Great service.  Within seconds of sitting a basket of fresh naan bread appears with a galaxy of yogurts, chutneys and sauces.  Water and coffee cups for Sue\'s amazing amphetamine tea.  After gorging yourself on Indian buffet you slip into the Indian food coma.  A dreamy, masala bliss.  You could sit there forever...but Sue runs a restaurant.  So the chai tea she serves is an upper.  I have no idea what\'s in it but it wakes you the fuck up and you can stumble home, back to school or work.  All for $6.50 plus tip.\n          \n""Wait what?"" yawns Autumn.  Even her yawns ends with a Pop! Crack! of gum.  ""I like Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Indian food.  Like fry bread or jerky.  But I don\'t like that dot-head, curry Thank you very much! - Indian food.""\n\nMelo laughs.  Dev looks peeved.  Kym stares at Autumn like dried human shit on the sidewalk.  I grin and look at Jason who is unfazed.  How can Jason let that go?  I\'ll tell you how.  That pug nosed girl fucks him.  A lot is forgiven when someone touches your penis.\n\n""Jason let\'s get American food ok?"" whines Autumn.  ""Like the diner.""\n\nJason nods serenely.  ""Yeah ok.  You hungry now?""\n\n""Yes.  I\'m gonna use the bathroom and we can go"" smiles Autumn.\n\nShe disappears down the hall.\n\n""We\'ll catch up with you guys later"" yawns Jason.  ""Where are you going tonight?""\n\n""Maybe Slims?  Some of the bands from the Free Tibet thing will be playing.""\n\nAs we debate where to go, I give Melo hash and coke and he rolls another joint and sticks it in Kym\'s bong.  We smoke and talk as Kym puts on her Rancid tape.  Then she goes into our bedroom to look at her face which is already perfect but she\'s a girl.  I know from the bedroom, she will go into the bathroom for the better light and check one last time in the hall mirror.  At every place we visit with a mirror you will find Kym in front of it.  I don\'t get it but I certainly don\'t mess with it.  \n\nAfter awhile Jason yawns.  I\'m so hungry I can smell korma and vindaloo in my empty skull.  Dev makes Melo go check on Autumn because she wants to pee before we go.  I hear him knocking on the bathroom door.  Then he comes back.\n\n""Jase.  That girl nodded out on the can.""\n\nWe all look.  Awkward.  Autumn is slumped over the toilet with her tights around her ankles, head in her lap and both arms dangle to the floor.  Looks like she fixed up, cleaned up, sat for a piss and lights out.  \n\n""Let\'s shave off one of her eyebrows"" smiles Kym maliciously.\n\n""One?"" asks Melo.\n\n""Yeah so she has to shave the other one herself.""\n\n""Man that\'s fucked up"" says Melo shaking his head.\n\n""I know right?"" giggles Kym.\n\nJason and Dev get her off the toilet.  She woke up for a second and seemed lucid as Dev yanked up her tights.\n\n""I what?""\n\n""You nodded on the toilet"" says Dev.\n\n""Oh.  Ok."" \n\nAnd she was out again.  Jason dumped her on his bed.  I rolled her on her side and Kym steals a piece of gum from her purse.\n\n""Ok Indian"" says Jason looking around.\n\nWe nod and grab our coats and file out the door.  Though summer is technically here, the nights are still freezing when the bay breeze slips in.  Indian food is perfect.  Heavy, filling and dreamy.   \n\n""I don\'t like that girl"" says Kym popping in the gum and gnashing it.  \n\nhttp://www.morbo2000.com/'"

In a haze coming off of smoking 20 roxies the night before, wishing I had just ONE left to bring me out of my sickness. It was the ultimate Catch-22. I felt like such a piece of shit that I couldn\'t do anything but think about scoring so I could study for my finals. My mind was racing, I knew I was going to fail my classes and time was running out. I wasn\'t going to go without a fight. No matter how hard I tried I just couldn\'t focus on my textbook. I knew that if I had some medicine in me I would be able to get some work done. I put all of my energy into finding some, and after many hours of laying in bed, staring at the clock, shaking and sweating, I got a phone call and knew relief was coming shortly. It was about time because it felt like a million scarabs were crawling under my skin, pushing against the walls and trying to escape like a bunch of trapped prisoners.\n\nI was too sick to get out of my bed so I had my medicine delivered straight to my room. I crawled out of bed and barely made it to the door. There it was, one little blue pill smaller than a penny, a pill with all the power in the world over me, a pill stronger than anyone and everyone. The mere thought of what was about to happen put some life back into my legs. I carefully stood up and frantically searched for the first piece of foil I could find and a tooter. I was about to be back in my world, the world I loved and was so comfortable in, the world that was quickly crumbling right before my eyes. But at that moment I didn\'t care. If my world was going down I was going down with it. I took a flame to the perfectly straightened foil and my eyes zoned in on the beautiful pill, sliding down the foil like a teardrop rolling down a cheek. This was my ritual and I loved it as much as getting high itself. I inhaled the dense, blissful smoke of the first hit into my tired lungs and immediately felt as if a thousand pounds were lifted off of my shoulders. Suddenly everything in the world was right again. The pain was gone. Things weren\'t as bad as they seemed. All my problems seemed to fade under a cover of that thick smoke. ""This is the life"" I thought to myself. With every hit I felt like a part of me was coming back, until I was whole again. Life felt so simple, but deep down I knew I was only fooling myself. I was extremely depressed, but so what, I had what I needed at the moment and I felt okay with myself. Now was not the time to think about my problems, ""I\'ll deal with those some other time.""\n\nI looked down at the foil and all I saw was a black spot. I tried to scrape one last hit but didn\'t get much. I finally felt decent enough to study, so I took out my textbook. Finally, now I can study like my life depends on it. I was so determined to pass this class and show my teacher that he was wrong. I read one word and thats when I realized how foolish I was. There was NO WAY in hell I was going to study. Now that I felt pretty good, all I wanted to do was enjoy my high. My mind was already on getting my next fix, so it\'s not like I could study even if I wanted to. I felt like such a dick because I told myself I was going to study after I got high, but I didn\'t care, I was too busy feeling good. I was so overwhelmed and torn that I broke down in tears. I didn\'t want this anymore, but I didn\'t know how to get out of it. I put myself in this trap, and I didn\'t even realize it. No one was answering my phone calls. My meds were wearing off and I knew it would be a long, cold, and sad night ahead. I wrapped myself in my blankets, just staring at the ceiling, trying my hardest to fall asleep. Sleep was my light at the end of the tunnel.""What a lucky guy I am"" I sarcastically thought to myself. All I had to look forward to was same pathetic miserable routine the next day. This was not the life I wanted to live, being miserable day after day, living for the short and ever fleeting moments of relief that my pills would bring me.'"

Not having to rely on shitty drug dealers and just making my way for myself. \n\nThis subject has been talked about in other shows where people say ""the apocalypse is the best thing that ever happened to me"". I would be saying the same damn thing whether it be a zombie plague, alien invasion, or just a giant financial collapse that results in the collapse of society and the government. I don\'t care what causes it, I just know I will be super happy if any kind of apocalypse happens. No more bullshit work life that I could never stand and despised since kindergarten. No more being forced to live in a daily routine that I hate and finally being able to live my life on my own terms. Maybe one day, but I doubt I\'ll ever have anything to do with causing it. Maybe I would if someone approached me and asked for me to help them but other than that IDK. \n\nWho else would love for an apocalypse to happen within our lifetimes? '"

I was anxious as hell and just wanted to get home as fast as possible. When I left Impact they gave me back my debit cards and since I lost my job a couple of weeks ago I assumed I had money so I could get home. So at 12 I went up to the seniors office and told them I was leaving. They tried and tried to get me to at least stay the night but the anxiety was so real I refused. They warned me that it was about to start to pour rain and without a sweatshirt I was going to be in real trouble but none of that was a concern to me. They escorted me out of the facility.\n\nI headed down to a gas station not to far to use an ATM and when I got there I put my card and pin in and checked the balance. 0.56 FUCK. I realized the mistake I made but there was no way I could go back now. I'm an idiot. Then it started to rain. I took shelter in a little cutout in a building and tried to get some sleep. I threw down some tee shirts and rested my head on them and fell asleep for a couple hours. \n\nWhen I woke up I was freezing cold. Nothing I did would help the extreme pain I was in from the pins and needles. So I stood up and waited for the sun to come up. A women walked by and asked if I had a cigarette. I told her I did but I needed to use a phone and she agreed. I called the only number I knew, my little brother and hoped to God he was awake. Nothing. I left a message explaining that I had checked out and the lady left. I started to panic. I was in a unfamiliar place with no direction. When the sun came up I took shelter in the business where I was waiting out the rain in. I stayed for a couple hours until they kicked me out and walked not knowing where I was going until I landed at a laundry mat to see if I could use another phone. Eventually someone let me and I got the same result as earlier. Left a message. I headed down to a bus stop and ask how they thought I could get home and got direction but I only had one gold dollar that happened to be floating around in my suitcase and prayed the bus driver would take it. He did.\n\nI ended up in old town Pasadena and walked a couple blocks not knowing where I was. By the grace of God I stumbled upon the metro and hoped on towards union station without a ticket. When I got there there was 2 cops standing guard of the stairway down into union checking tickets. I followed the crowd and snuck by luckily. I found the train that would take me home and pretended like I lost my ticket but they wouldn't let me get on. I headed down to the ticket booth and begged people for a ticket. I finally got one. I wish I knew the lady that bought me one because I seriously owe her my life.\n\nI ran back up to the deck and missed the train by minutes... I was pissed that I had to wait another 3 hours for the next train but remembered I was lucky to get as far as I had. Train came I boarded and we took off towards Lancaster. I couldn't wait to get off but I knew I still had to walk a long way to get home. When my stop came up I got off and started the long journey home. Every step was painful, I was starving, cold, and tired. I walked about 5 miles until I finally made it home and climbed through a window. My parents were not happy to see me and they contemplated kicking throwing me out hungry, broken, and with no direction but I was able to calm all the damage I had done over the last 2 years. \n\nRemember everybody. Your family is the only thing you really have. Never forget it and never take it for granted. Be safe and be humble. """

I now realize why so many of us relapse. At least this has been my experience thus far.\n\n\nAt 11 years old my mom got sick. I was told she was in the hospital because even though I\'ve always been pretty smart my mind was still too young to fully grasp that she was having a mental breakdown. Years later I would come to find out it was a mental hospital. My little brother and sister along with my mom moved from Virginia back in with family in Alabama while my dad stayed and worked in D.C.\n\n\nI worked in my uncles chicken houses for the summer between 5th and 6th grade. This would mark the beginning of my downward spiral. \n\n\nFinally In November My dad joined us and we moved to the suburbs once again south of Atlanta, Georgia. At 13 years old I first started cutting. At 14 I started burning myself. I didn\'t know why at the time I just felt that it helped. I realize now that out of all the pain I was feeling, harming myself was the only thing I could control. \n\n\nIn 8th grade I smoked pot and drank for the first time. Marijuana was a godsend. No longer did I have to deal with all the pain and hurt, I could just numb it and push it away. I used that maybe 5 times between 14-15. Then after a harsh break up I began to smoke everyday. \n\n\nNumb the pain. Block it out\n\n\nI went to my first psych ward at 16 years old for suicidal ideation. I was on some neurological medication for headaches prescribed by some Chinese fuckwit that was know to cause suicidal thoughts in teens and young adults.\n\n\nFrom the age of sixteen I would go on try all of the classic psychedelics, downers, uppers, dissociatives and a myriad of research chemicals. I was placed in rehab for pot at the young age of 16. See my parents were from a small little town in Alabama. My mother had never even seen pot before. So I was placed with kids much worse of than I was. 15 year olds addicted to shooting dilaudid, smoking crystal meth and everything between.\n\n\nNumb the pain. Block it out\n\n\nI got out and continued smoking. At the age of 17 two weeks after my birthday I was thrown in big boy jail for going into unlocked cars in my yuppie fuck school parking lot while on ten milligrams of klonopin. I had three counts of felony entering auto. I didn\'t talk to my parents for a week. I was terrified to say the least. After no contact I finally talk to my father after hearing my name called for visitation. I sat in jail till Christmas until I was placed in another rehab/juvenile boot camp In Alabama for 45 days. \n\n\nNumb the pain. Block it out\n\n\nAfter getting out I stayed ""clean"" for maybe three months before I broke into the same gas station 4 times. They don\'t teach you not to hit the same lick more than once in any textbook I\'ve ever read. At this point I\'m doing online schooling. The cops show up at 1pm with a warrant for my arrest. Off we go again.\n\n\nNumb the pain. Block it out\n\n\nI sit in jail again for 4 months awaiting trial. I plead out to 5 years first offender probation for three counts of 2nd degree burglary. Thank god I\'m a white boy with a father with good connections.\n\n\nNumb the pain. Block it out\n\n\nOnce again I get out. Start smoking pot. Can\'t or refuse to stop fucking up. It is now October 2013. I\'m 18, have no job, no education, and no option but to work towards getting my shit straight. \n\n\nNumb the pain. Block it out\n\n\nI get my GED and start working two jobs as delivery driver while selling pot on the side. I take my ACT in the beginning of 2014 and score high enough to get into college. I start selling pot on the side to help pay my bills and probation. \n\n\nNumb the pain. Block it out\n\n\nSummer 2014 is here. I fail drug test after drug test for pot for probation. All while eating and selling, mushrooms, acid, pot and mdma. I get a permit to travel to Alabama to stay clean and work construction with family. The pain comes back full force. \n\n\nNumb the pain. Block it out\n\n\nI go to college and stay in class for two weeks before I\'m getting high and drinking everyday. I meet contacts for everything and start doing the same shit again. The pain subsides. But only for a little awhile before I am arrested again. Thank god for bumfuck nowhere towns in Alabama. I knew I would bond out when they pull out paper to fingerprint and the cells have actual bars on them. No computers no criminal history pops up. I bond out the next morning with a court date and my first misdemeanor charges for possession of marijuana and paraphernalia. To most people this would be a wake up call. But not me. I continue doing the same thing until I meet this girl.\n\n\nNumb the pain. Block it out\n\n\nI eventually have to get the hell\nOut of my wondeful little college town. So I head back to Atlanta to stay with a buddy for a week and give everyone a chance to look for me where I won\'t be found. At this point im living off pot, pabst, and hotdogs. I turn 19. I meet this girl while tripping on mescaline and decide to move into her moms basement. Running from the law and broke again it seems like the best option. \n\n\nNumb the pain. Block it out\n\n\nEventually I get kicked out for being a bum and spending the rent and Bill\nMoney on drugs. Time to move back with Mommy and daddy. They welcome me home with open arms hoping I\'ve seen the error of my ways. Within a week I\'m arrested for possession of paraphernalia because I hadn\'t cleaned out my truck and tossed my pipes I grabbed from my girls house when I moved. \n\n\nNumb the pain. Block it out\n\n\nThey bond me out for the first time. I walk into probation and plead for mercy yet again. They sanction me and force me to a year of drug court. I stop smoking for 7 months but can\'t face the pain.\n\n\nNumb the pain. Block it out\n\n\nI get a job at subway and they hard work I become a manager within a month. I start ordering sheets of 25d to sell and eat. Finally I find something that would ultimately fuck me up worse than any drug I\'ve ever put up my nose, in my lungs, or in my belly. MXE. I do it every day for 3 months straight. All while pissing clean for probation and maintaining my shitty little job. \n\n\nNumb the pain. Block it out\n\nThen comes the needles. I shoot MXE for a month straight and leave the 25d alone. Find a contact for legitimate lad-25 and start selling and eating that every few days on top of smoking pot and drinking. The pain is still surfacing. I look\nInto the eyes of my family, friends, and coworkers with a straight face every single day and lie. That I\'m alright. That I\'m clean. That I\'m fucking happy. \n\nNumb the pain. Block it out\n\n\nAfter awhile I just can\'t take it. Three months ago I found heroin. Or she found me. And finally I can escape the pain. I save $600 dollars to go on the road trip with my two best friends. Friends who I would take a bullet for and would do the same for me. Two men who i could not be any closer to even if we came out the same womb. The time comes to take the trip and I\'m down to $100 dollars. Back to being a bum. \n\n\nNumb the pain. Block it out\n\n\nWe come back. My buddy stays in Nevada. My other buddy in Alabama. And me back to reality. I can\'t keep it up forever. I quit my job. Continue selling. Continue shooting dope. Starting to slip. No longer can I fool anyone. They all know. They don\'t know the full extent but they know. They can always tell when shit is about to hit the fan. \n\n\nNumb the pain. Block it out\n\n\nFinally my grandma who used to be a nurse find the little orange cap. She fucking knows I\'ve been injecting shit in my arms. She sees the tracks the weight loss and the sunken pinned eyes and knows. I must escape. \n\n\nNumb the pain. Block it out\n\n\nI call a rehab in Michigan and get the fuck out of Georgia. Got on a plane and just left. I leave after two weeks because it becomes too much. My buddy flies me to Nevada. I crash for two weeks. Smoke pot. Take suboxone. Drink. \n\n\nNumb the pain. Block it out\n\n\nFinally I call my probation officer and tell her everything. Honesty is the best policy right? Now I have a warrant out for my name.\n\n\nWhy won\'t it just go away.\n\n\n I go back to my college town and crash at my buddies house for a few more weeks. Just smoke pot and take suboxone and everything will be okay. Or so I tell myself. I turn myself in and get down on my knees and beg. She tells me I must stay wth family. No drug test no reprimands, sanctions, jail time, or anything. She takes one look at my crying mother and can\'t do it. This is now my sixth P.O.\n\n\nNumb the pain. Block it out\n\n\nAnd here I am. Twenty years old. I have a GED and am working minimum wage living with my grandparents again. No progress. 5 years worth of pain hits me full force.\n\n\nNumb the pain. Block it out\n\n\nI smoke pot. I take acid. And I lose my fucking mind yet again. But I realize something. I  have  subconsciously been trying get myself sent to prison to punish myself for all the hell I have brought upon my family. And until I work through my issues and forgive myself for all the people I have conned, robbed, stolen from, lied to and fucked over I will never stop using. It will continue to eat me alive until I either end up in prison, OD, or blow my fucking brains out.\n\nI know what I must do to repair the damage I have done. Am I strong enough to do it?\n\n\nEmbrace the pain. Work through it.\n'"

A needle, cooker(lighter if its BTH), a cotton, a wrap-tie-off thing(forgot what its called, i\'m an idiot. Like a belt or shoe string or whatever).\n\nNow clearly, they get these things and use them til they absolutely can not any more. They don\'t have money to spend on new needles, clean cottons, etc. Maybe they get to shoot up in a bathroom once in a while, but I bet most of the time its under a bridge or in an alley.\n\nSo, if anyone wouldn\'t mind answering these questions\n\n1. How did you aquire your drug(s), what did you use, and how did you use it? If shooting up, how did you get the stuff you needed to shoot up, and how did you keep it ""clean""\nWh\n2. How did you afford your addiction? How much did you use, and how often?\n\n3. How often were you in withdrawl?\n\n4, If you were in a shelter, was there any open help for addicts?\n\n5. Are you homeless now? If so, what kind of conditions? If not, how did you become not homeless any more? Are you still an addict?\n\nAny other questions people come up with I can add to this post.

3niomn,NorcoNarcoNarcan,10/4/2015 20:04:02,b'A little anecdote',"b'A couple of years ago I took a class trip to Italy after graduating senior year of high school. I had a half bun a day habit at the time. Well of course I became dope sick without my golden brown friend to accompany me and I found myself vomiting and shitting my intestines out, freezing and burning, kicking in my bed and contemplating suicide in my hotel room on the first day. While everyone else was visiting the Vatican, I was in hell. People kept inquiring as to how or why I got sick as everyone else was perfectly fine. Tired of the endless questions I began telling people that I was sick from withdrawing from my prescribed medications, a girl that was into me kept on pestering me about what medication I had been taking and I finally just said Codeine. She looked at me condescendingly and said ""You know Codeine is like a hard drug right?"" Agitated, irritable, and sick of her shit I said, ""Nah that\'s really just a lie, I\'m actually going through heroin withdrawal right now, but Rome is nice enough to distract me from the pain and depression that comes with it."" She looked at me disgusted and never talked to me again. Damn was my trip better when I got that bitch off my back. I was moved pretty emotionally from my excursion and made the decision to quit...until our flight back home was delayed 8 hours and I couldn\'t smoke a single cig. With little contemplation, the first thing I did when I returned home was text my d boy, buy a pack of cigarettes, and subsequently a bun. Good times. '"

I can never seem to stay away for too long, months and years go by and eventually I get that urge to use again.\n\nI got the urge late last month and found nothing but frustration.  $6 for a Vicodin, $1 a mg for oxycodone, $2 an mg for oxymorphone.  I bitched and complained and refused to pay those prices (they're really high compared to what I was used to).  The prices kept going up and up.  I scored some 30mg roxis for $15 a pop only to have the guy jack them up to $25 when I came around a few days later.  I had given up hope.\n\nThen out of nowhere a man with H appeared.  I tried a bump, only my second time with this lovely stuff (lack of access).  It felt just like morphine...I am in love.\n\nLast night I sent a txt, within an hour I had a $50 bag in my hands and a bump in my nose.  I chilled with the dude for two hours and we got a long well.  He's hooking me up with a job and we've made plans to chill this week.  We instantly got a long...it was strange and it wasn't the dope.  Our pasts are so similar (farm boys) and our way of thinking is pretty much the same.  We discussed politics over 20mg of oxymorphone and bowls of the finest kush.\n\nNo I sit here knowing that I'm facing down the path of addiction again.  I had half the bag left over this morning after an all night nod session.  I held out for three hours until my nose started to run.  The sickness is already creeping back in to my life, I had a bump to straighten myself out.  I know I'm going back over there tomorrow or the next day to spend another $50 or more.\n\nThe Holidays are coming up too...funny how almost every time I've come back to the life it is right around the Holidays.  I'm sure my depression about where I am in life and my family coming in to remind me what a loser I am has something to do with that.\n\nI'm coming to terms with the fact that I can't ever quit this shit.  It's like a demon that lives inside of me.  I'm sure within a few months I'll be signing up for the clinic and lining up for my daily dose of 'done.  I don't really see another way...\n\nUntil then I'm content with riding this H train as far as my money will take me.  I have given up, I am beaten, this is all I have anymore. """

They\'re obviously getting it in bulk and cheap. And its gotta pretty much be exclusively the higher up guys, the lower guys probably either don\'t cut it or cut it with flour or some non-narcotic shit.\n\nOn the other hand, is BTH even cut with any opiates?

I don\'t mean for this to be a ""bragging"" or ""self promotion"" or a ""hookup"" thread, not at all. Just maybe give some of y\'all ideas on how to help yourself a little, help someone else, and everyone is happy. Even get some criticism/ideas from y\'all!\n\nBasically, people hit me up. Usually from the-subreddit-that-shall-not-be-named (pm me if you\'re interested ). I live in one of the worlds most premiere and visited tourist cities, so a lot of the time it\'s people from out of town visitng, but most of the time it\'s locals.\n\nFor those visiting and staying on the strip(and usually don\'t have a car), I basically say ""okay. yeah I have a good connect for X Y and Z drug. Do you have a car? No, okay then, you will have to buy $X amount in order for us to deliver. It\'s a long drive and my dealer wont do it for $40 worth. My car is broke right now, so basically he has to come get me then we have to meet up with you. Is it cool if you throw him like 5-10 bucks for gas? Okay cool. And for this connect, I charge 0.5g of black, which is about $40. After that, you get his number/meet him, wont have to go through me any more. Is that cool? Alright see you in an hour"".\n\nFor locals its similar. I tell them straight up I charge 0.5g, come scoop me, we meet up with the dealer, you get to meet him/his number(as long as he thinks you\'re cool, which everyone has been so far). Boom, done. Sometimes we become ""friends"", sometimes its literally just a one-and-done deal.\n\nDo you guys think this is fair? Like I said, I only tax them about usually $40 worth of BTH and then they get the connect so they can go without have me middlemanning as often as they please.\n\nHonestly, I think I should charge more, like $60 flat, and I can just spend that on what I want(prob some black and just some cash). The only problem is, a lot of the time, these people are only picking up like, a gram or whatever(which is fine! I get it. I don\'t pick up much when I cop anyway. I was just using it as a detail for my next sentence). So it\'s kinda hard to ask em for $60 when they only planned on buying $80 worth lol. \n\nThese deals take an hour maybe 25% of the time, hour and 45 minutes about 50% of the time, the other times they can take 2 and a half hours, even 3 once in a long while. That\'s quite a bit of my time to help this person out(I know, I know, im not doing it for free...) and i\'m also risking both my and my dealer(s) necks by doing this. I always do research(via reddit) of course of these people and if anything seems off then its a big fat ""No cant help ya sorry"". \n\nAlso, how much should I be asking from the dealers for all the business i\'m giving them?

Before that I'd tried pretty much every drug but an opiate, but was always on the lookout for em.

So I had to switch to the inexpensive way which is to inject H3.\n\nFuck man. I didn't know it was so hard to inject yourself properly, esp since my dominant hand has bad nerve trouble atm (temporary). I'd done so much research prior on correct technique and vein maps etc etc so I thought it'd be easy esp since I'm thin and can see quite a few veins. I was going into w/ds by the time id got my H3 last week so I was desperately scrambling to cook it and shoot up. With as much patience as I could manage, I tried to find a vein. For the life of me I could not draw blood on any visible vein I tried to hit so I just so I plugged in desparation to get through. Plugging H3 is way worse than sniffing H4 imo.

So, here's a quick history first:\n\nLong term opiate user, 15+ years. Was on subs for 2.5 years until ~45 days ago. Used Kratom for ~30 days to get subs out of my system and procure opiates. Then, I started a real opiate binge about 2 weeks ago.\n\nSo far, I've been through 2.5+g of #4, 20 Oxy 30mg Blues, 20 Vicodin, and 1.25g of BTH. So far, the only thing that got me even remotely high was the 1.25g of BTH (smoked 1g in a day).\n\nI assume that subs ruined my receptors. The binge before the subs (and after a 1.5 year methadone treatment) was beautiful, 1 Norco 10 got me blitzed for a few weeks, then topped out at 3 then switched to blues and sniffing half would put me in a crazy nod. So, WTF??\n\nAnyways, recently, everything other than the BTH at least registered to some degree (meaning I felt it - not a high - but something happened), but now these two different kinds of #4 I have are doing NOTHING except keeping me out of WDs.\n\nI have seriously snorted .25g of #4 within a few hours today and received no effect. I can't bang right now for several reasons. I'm considering plugging now, but I don't know if it's worth it.\n\nAnyways, wtf do I do? I know these bags of #4 are legit because they get me well off of just a bump or two. I can't believe there is that much of a gap between the threshold of stopping WDs and feeling something. And, eating half an Oxy 30 was, at least, registering and getting me a mild, mild, buzz - no real euphoria, but a feel good feeling, some itch and a little warmth. So, I know my tolerance isn't THAT high. \n\nI can't understand what's going on here. I don't want to plug because I feel like maybe (in some amazingly impossible coincidence) both of these types of #4 were made in a way that gives them a horrible BA when sniffed... they need to be shot or plugged, maybe? But, I'm near the end of both bags and don't want to just shove it all up my butt and die or do too little and waste it. \n\nIs this even possible? Or am I just doomed to never feel opiates again - even though I did feel them recently? Maybe I blew my tolerance up even more with that day of BTH?\n\nHELP, I will have more tar in 3-4 days to end out my failed binge with something resembling a good time (going back on subs). I just want to feel one tiny little buzz before going back on Kratom to wait for the BTH. \n\nBut, really, the point of this post is to find out if I'm totally insane. Or maybe this is really the hell that a former Subutex-treated 15+ year opiate abuser lives in? Like, I just can't even do my favorite thing in the world now? :( \n\n\n**TL;DR: I can't seem to get high. Done way too many opiates and not feeling shit except from smoking 1g of BTH in a day. Stuck without BTH for a few days and have 2 kinds of #4 that are not working when sniffed. Is this really my life or do I need to just snort .5 of #4 all at once? WTF?**\n"""

I haven't even read it yet just typed it up in iPhone notes and pasted below.\n\n\nI'm reaching that age now. The age where people are deciding on the direction they are gonna head in life and working towards it. And I have so many things I want to do but no means to accomplish them. \n\n\n\nAnother day where shooting dope would push away the problems. The regrets. The memories. A quick fix for a temporary problem. A black hole that just feeds off negative energy.

The account my family put their hard earned dollars into. The account they set up when I was born and they knew I would conquer the world. \n\n\n\nSome days I still feel like that's a possibility.

She set me up with a guy who has been pretty good, always answers my calls even early in the morning, is pretty timely, and from eyeballing it the weights seem right to me. Quality is decent. Downside, he\'s very paranoid, insists on speaking in code, he\'s hard to understand because of how ""ghetto"" he speaks (which is fine by me, I just literally catch every other word out of his mouth.) He also kisses me on the cheek several times in the 2 minute transaction, and slaps my ass on the way out. Oh well, at least I\'m not sick while she\'s away. So today, he wasn\'t answering, which was really weird. Today was the first day of my new job I\'m really excited about, as a vet assistant (I\'m in school to become a Vet Tech.) It\'s not a job I can afford to be sick at, grueling 12-13 hour shifts with no sitting or downtime and more than one or two bathroom breaks is frowned upon. He\'s not answering so I resign myself to a sick rest of shift/day. Fast forward to my lunch break, when I was hoping to pick up. My new coworker gave me 5 dollars to go get her Taco Bell since I was going to pass one on the way back to work. Her change was 1.35, and I had 89 dollars, so I dug around in a purse pocket I hardly use to get some quarters for her so I could keep the paper dollar. I feel some change, pull out my hands to see what I had and literally screamed out loud when I saw what I was holding among the quarters, nickels, dimes, and pennies. 4 8mg dilaudids were staring at my dumbfounded face. Further digging in that pocket presented a total of NINE DILLIES and a bonus 5mg flexeril. And then right towards the end of my shift the guy got back to me. TODAY WAS A GOOD DAY EVERYONE. :) '"

Haha.\n\nFor all of you who've quit doing H (whether you went back to it or stayed clean), I'm curious about what you did with all your spoons, foil, needles, etc. Did you throw everything away immediately, or did it take you a long time to get rid of it (and if so, why)?\n\nMy wife has always told me that she would stop doing H if she could find a doctor who would prescribe her what she needed for chronic pain instead of just Vicodin or whatever. Well, she seems to have met that doctor and got scripts that should definitely help. \n\nShe tells me she isn't doing H anymore, but I'm having a really hard time believing her. I think the main reason is that the bathroom that she used in is still a trainwreck with crap everywhere. She gets defensive when I ask about it (which makes me suspicious even more), so I don't really know. I can't tell whether the stuff is old or has been used recently. But I feel like if it were me, I'd get rid of everything immediately. I don't know. \n\nI know she kind of hit her rock bottom bc she got arrested for the first time (she was sleeping in the car after having insomnia for multiple days and some bitch called the cops and they searched and found stuff).

I didn't go out and had no desire to do anything, even play video games. I've also been clean for about a week and half cuz I spent all my money on about 20+ blues the week prior, which at this point feels like an eternity since I've been without them. Sunday night rolls around, and as I'm getting ready to go to bed, I stand up from my chair, and the middle of my back is in excruciating pain. I don't know what I did to cause it.

My current back pain hurts the most when I try to bend over to pick something up, and my left Achilles tendon hurts so much.\n\nI guess the point of this post is to just address how much it sucks, when you actually do need opiates for pain, and you can't even get them.

Mainly, how serious the stigma is behind using drugs. On here, on this site, I can feel free to talk about my biggest exploits, my most embarrasing moments, and real low times in my life without worrying about everyone judging me and calling me a piece of shit, because weve all been there, or at least close, and if not we at least know that drugs dont make you a complete failure/waste of space. Im finding out in the past couple weeks, that no matter what, if you are a junkie and yer surrounded by sober people (or even cokeheads/alcoholics/pill poppers, ironically), you are automatically a bad person and should not be around for any reason, period.)\n\nI am learning this now because, well for the past 3 years, I have been working in aggriculture in a very small town in Nor Cal, and it has been a great 3 years. making lots of money. the first year i was on pills for a small amount of time, the second year i was on pills heavy the whole time and a little H, and this year i have been using H heavier than i ever have in my life, and low and behold, this year, the whole valley is thinking about 86\'ing me from work. Im hearding second hand of course that no one wants to work with me, witch is the real reason ive been out of a job i was promised, and possible out of the whole job next year. Things have been going missing from one of the houses the workers stay at, so of course, it was me, the junkie. According to my bosses, im a liar, a thief and i cant be trusted. also none of the workers want to work with me because they are ""afraid of having their ipod stolen"".\n\nAs im sure there are many of you who understand, drugs dont make you a bad person. which is why this is so hard for me to understand. I have done nothing but bust my ass for these people, and helped them out as much as i had the chance, going out of my way for numerous things, but no matter what i do or how good i am to them, all they want to do is talk shit and fuck things up for me because im such a ""piece of shit"". its really upsetting.. i could have done more to hide it but i just feel like thats not the right thing to do, hide who you are from people, its just not honest. so i didnt. i didnt go around advertising my usage to people but i didnt deny it either. plus in such a small town, word travels faster than the speed of light. so the minute my addiction came to light, im no longer wanted in this particular valley. \n\nthe most ironic part about it is, the last two bosses i had were the biggest bosses in the valley, they were also serious tweakers/alcoholics, totally unstable and fucked up people. Two of them (a cokehead and a tweaker)conspired to steal over $120k worth of merchandise from me last year. something no one batted an eye at. yet, me, a heroin addict, allegedly stole 1500 worth from someone, and now im considered a piece of shit. I just dont understand why the stigma with dope is so fucking bad compared to the stigma behind meth and coke and alcohol. i know theres also politics involved in this certain situation but even outside of this, it seems like no one who suffers from addiction is worth a goddamn minute of anyone elses time... just really erks me because i try my hardest to do what i can for people and this is what i get in return. just for being who i am. \n\nSorry for the big rant you guys but i had to get this off of my chest its really been fuckin with me lately.

I havent felt happiness in years and you brought it out of me.  Always a pessimist, for once, I understood the feeling of optimism.  That was the strangest thing for me, finally knowing something that was utterly foreign to me my whole life through a decade of adulthood.  \n\nYou may not be completely cognizant of it or understand the extent to which its true, but you motivated me in ways that I didnt think were possible.  You made me feel good about myself when I didnt think there was a way to piece together my utterly shattered self-esteem, when I thought there was no hope for someone to care for a piece of shit like me.  You gave me confidence and made it worth it to me to risk everything.  Your presence in my life gave me the push I needed to pull the trigger on taking steps to begin achieving my hearts desire.  \n\nWith your help, whether you know it or not, I left a job that made me miserable.  I left a living situation I hated.  I moved to a city I love.  I wrote a business plan that got funded.  I started using my connections to find a job that will get me where I want to be mentally and financially.  I decided to leave behind crippling depression that has plagued me for years.  Could I have achieved these things on my own?  Yeah, probably.  But they wouldnt have happened with such quickness and certainly without such purpose.  \n\nAnd that is why I am absolutely terrified that I might lose you.  You caught me smoking dope the other night.  You said it wasnt necessarily the fact it was dope that bothered you, that you had a problem with my secrecy.  That the problem was my being inconsiderate and not asking permission.  That the problem was how I put things in your life at risk with my carelessness.  I completely understand that.  You are right to be pissed at me because I'm even more pissed at myself than you could ever be.  I care for you more than I can express, and those things, though I didnt consider it at the time, dont reflect that.  I dont want any act of carelessness to make me less fun to be around or to put anything in your life at risk. I understand that much of my behavior could be viewed as impulsive or thoughtless, but all of it prior that incident was motivated by my desire to be with you.  \n\nIm not mad at you for wanting to put the brakes on things.  I understand a lot of what must be going through your mind and I dont want you to have to deal with the embarrassment that comes with saying your boyfriend is couch hopping, homeless, unemployed, and addicted to opiates.  That stack of truths, partially a product of poor decisions and partially a product of my desire to put myself in your life before it became too late, is tough for me to even type.  It may sound romantic to some that I took many of the aforementioned risks in attempt to pursue you, but I also realize it doesnt entitle me to your heart and it doesnt make the undesirable truths about my current life status any less avoidable.  \n\nSo I want to use this letter to tell you what I want, my hearts desire more than anything.  These are my goals.  When I have goals that I truly want, I do whatever is in my power to get them.  In the past, Ive lost significant amounts of weight.  Ive quit drugs cold turkey.  Ive saved relationships that were on the rocks.  Ive started businesses and escaped the 9-5 grind.  Ive done a lot of things that seem like theyre impossible.  \n\nRecently, I made it to the city you live in against all odds.  I got out of the soul-crushing job by which I felt utterly trapped.  Ive scored two job offers in the past month off the strength of my friendships.  Ive managed to pull together a living arrangement that will last until I can get a place on my own.  And I will accomplish the things below if you will let me.  You dont owe me these things, but I hope with all of my heart that you will allow them to happen because I dont believe you will find someone who wants you more than me.  I dont think you will find someone who will love you more than me.  I dont think you will find someone who admires you in every way as much as me.  I don't want these things to happen any faster than you want to let them happen but I hope there is a possibility that they can become reality at some point.  So here it goes.\n\nI want to be your boyfriend.  I want to be your lover.  I want to be the man in your life that sends tingles up your spine.  I want to be someone you can be proud of.  I want to protect you.  I want to have a job that allows me the luxury of being able to pay for everything when we go out.  I want to have an apartment by the beach that you love to go to.  I want to be the reason you smile in the morning and the reason you can peacefully sleep every night.  I want to be your confidant, the person you can tell anything without fear of judgement.  I want to be the person you explore the world with.  I want to learn from you and I want to be able to teach you as well.  I dont want to be perfect but I do want you to be able to correct me when Im wrong and help me to be a better man.  You make me want to be a better man.  I dont want to lie to you ever again.  I want to be someone you love enough to forgive.  I want to wake up next to you every morning and enjoy the sweet smell of your hair.  I want to be the person that makes you feel loved all the time, giving you the compliments and affection you deserve.  I want to be the person that is your refuge from stress.  I want to be the best sex youve ever had and I want to fulfill all of your fantasies.  I want to get back on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication so you dont have to deal with me ever being unstable.  Honestly, that might also have something to do with the better sex thing as well.  I want to go to shows with you.  I want to ride bikes with you.  I want to share music with each other.  I want to be your everything.\n\nMost of all, I want to be opiate-free.  You said it didnt necessarily bother you that I was using dope in the incident that provoked you to want to chill on us for a while.  Perhaps thats true but I dont want something as stupid as drugs to ever be a point of contention between us.  I dont want anything at all to be a point of contention between us.  I dont want anything in my life that makes me ashamed of who I am and makes you ashamed of the decisions I make.  I want to make decisions that make you proud and I want to be someone who is a constant source of joy in your life.  I told you this already but the decision between getting high and being with you is an easy one for me.  Perhaps its a decision you arent even asking of me.  Thats ok.  I want to make it for myself.  I want you to know that you can safely invest yourself in me emotionally without worrying about my life being at risk or worrying whether Im lying to hide embarrassment or shame.  You are better than any drug.   \n\nA few weeks ago, you told me you love me.  Those were words I have waited so long to hear, and to hear them from you was the most fantastic gift I could ever imagine.  I immediately said it back to you because I had known I felt that way for a while.  Perhaps the fact that it happened so fast played a factor in you wanting to hit the brakes.  I understand that, but I also hope that doesnt make it any less true.  I hope that it at least means you wont forget me and that I still have a chance to achieve all of the goals Ive listed.  I dont want to bother you while I get my life together, but I hope more than anything we can start anew a little bit down the road and we can build our relationship stronger than it could have been without this wake up call.  I have cried and cried over the fear that my chance with you may be gone but I am determined to be the man you deserve if youll let me.  """

Although i did comment very regularly back 2-3 years ago. \n\n\nSo i\'m from Australia; the land of over priced drugs. And was a dope / Oxy addict for a good 3 years. I\'ve currently been on Methadone / Suboxone and now again Methadone the last 2 an\' half years. I was on 80mg and have my made my way down to 10mg. Yay nearly off, So i\'m at the point where i can start chipping again.\n\nBut our heroin is very very expensive; approx $150 for a ""Quart"" (2.5 points) and the purity is probably less then in the US. \n\nBut our chemists are very generous with OTC opiates. \n\nSo i strolled down to local chemist and picked up the following items:\n1 x Bottle of DXM Syrup\n1 x Pack of 25mg Promethazine\n1 x 40 pack of 15mg Codeine / 500mg APAP\n1 x Bottle Of Rikodiene 200ml (Contains 380mg Of Dihydrocodeine and A LOT OF sorbitol which can cause a literally pissing out of your ass. aha )\n\nSo my combination went as followed;\nT+0 Took, 30mg of DXM and 25mg of Promethazine\nT+35 Took 400mg of CWE\'d Codeine \nT+1h5 Ingested 380mg of Dihydrocodeine \n\nI have to say the high is fucking excellent, I was nodding hard and the body high was really strong, along with the euphoria. Comparable to say 60-80mg of Oxy although very different high.\n\n The promethazine also got rid of that irritating histamine reaction that comes along with the codeine. \n\nthe codeine clogs you up enough to counteract the effects of the sorbitol. so no explosive diarrhea and no constipation. \n\nOverall a fantastic experience for all OTC supply\'s. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'"

The past 5 days have I have been in minor opiate withdrawal after a 7 day H bender. It has been 5 days since my last dose and although my physical symptoms are pretty much all gone, I am still having difficulty sleeping, I have also been experiencing RLS. Before minor opiate withdrawal I have never had any issues with sleeping what so ever. I have gone through mild withdrawals quite a few times this past year, but this is the first time that sleep has been a major issue. During what I would consider minor WDs compared to many other people, I usually suffer flu like sweats, chills, aches, hot flashes, anxiety, depression and RLS for about 3-4 days. My question is, when will it be easier for me to fall asleep and remain asleep?? I have been taking supplements/meds such as Melatonin, xanax, and other sleep aids but nothing too heavy. When will I be able to get a good nights rest!? This lack of sleep is driving me crazy and even though my physical WD symptoms are gone, I feel like shit because of how little sleep I am getting. What is your experience with sleep deprivation and opiate WD? How long did it or does it usually take for one to be able to get a good nights rest? Also what medications/methods are good for treating/managing RLS? I would love to hears some tips for RLS and Sleep during WDs, lots of love you guys! sorry for this long post, I just really need advice. '"

My tolerance was very low cause it had been a while since doing any dope. I come out of the bathroom feeling like a million dollars, only for my coworker to tell me the boss called and I need to go meet him upstate, about 2 hours away. I've never been to this place and driving in a commercial vehicle means I can't take the parkways, which is what the gps wants me to do. Whatever, I'll figure it out.\nI get on the BQE and head over into the Bronx. Just as I go through the toll on the triboro bridge, I feel the nausea I have come to love. Almost immediately I start projectile vomitting out the window. People are honking, there's chunks on my mirror and all down the side. Whatever, I feel better I'll keep going. \nMy phone dies shortly after. I turn on the CB and start trying to get directions from truckers but no ones answering. Fuck. Pull into a Dunkin donuts to get a coffee, directions, and do another bag.\nHalf nodding I end up passing my boss and coworker about 20 minutes later and my boss goes on the CB to tell me to whip a u turn and catch up with them. I do so right there and my boss starts cracking up saying how crazy I am etc. \nAll is well from this point on, until we pull over and the boss hops in the truck with me. What's wrong with you he asks. You look weird. I tell him nothing I'm just starving haven't eaten all day etc. He says good cause we're going to get lunch. He takes me and my coworker to a Chinese buffet and tells us that it's on the company, so pig out. God damn I ate like a king. At least 7 plates filled up. All is great.\nUntil we all get back in my truck and I projectile vomit again. This time on my boss."""

This morning, Around 9:30 AM, I goofed and insufflated half a bag of dope. I immediately regretted my decision (immediately = about 15/30 min later) and began blowing my nose, spitting any drip, doing everything I could to do an emergency evacuation on my nasal cavity. I had something I had to take care of, so I wasn\'t able to deep clean with saline until about two hours later, but ultimately I did blast my nose with an absurd amount of saline. I know some of the dope still crossed over because I certainly felt it, but I know it was far less than I consumed. I\'m now drinking PLENTY of water, have taken some metabolism boosters i.e. B complex, Raspberry Ketone, other ""Fat burners"" (i have a fast metabolism to begin with, also), have taken a shot of apple cider vinegar and will be taking some midol for a diuretic. I also plan to do a fair bit of exercise today. My concern is that, being on Drug court, I may have to drop tomorrow. IF I do, I can drop as late as 4:30 PM. I do not want to have to dilute, if possible. Though, if that is my only option, I\'m not opposed (it\'ll result in a 24 hr sit in the clink but it\'s better than actually dropping hot imo). How likely is it that I will come up positive? Are than any other tips for cleansing? Was clearing my nose ASAP a wasted effort, or is it going to work in my favor? \nAgain, I know I am a fool for having slipped up in the first place, and I take full responsibility for it - But if I have a chance to make it through this with no problems, I\'d (naturally) like to know.

3r2v0a,1tmepostr,11/1/2015 7:51:05,"b'Depressing Rant- Blah, blah, blah life sucks'","b""Okay, sorry in advance, I know these posts are somewhat annoying, and nobody really wants to read them. I am just feeling really down lately. I am addicted to prescription meds, mostly hydrocodone and oxycodone. On average I use about 180mg of hydro, or 120 mgs of oxycodone a day.\n\n\nI have been wanting to get clean lately. I have been depressed, and even the opiates haven't helped me feel like myself. I think quitting is what I need. So basically my sources are going to be dry for a few days, and my bank account is almost in the pennies. Two days ago I took 50 mgs of oxy, and yesterday I had another 30 mgs. I probably shouldn't have done that considering I'd be on day 3 today, but I am here stuck on day 1, again... I am hoping the withdrawal will be somewhat easier now that I have reduced my intake so dramatically. Or, it might now matter at all. Anyways, I hope once I get a week or two in that I won't start chipping again thinking I am in the clear. I do that shit every time, and then I find myself back to daily use. \n\n\nI am in a midlife crisis basically. I am just about to graduate college. I have tons of student loans to repay, credit card debt, no savings, and a few items in the pawn shop. I have no job lined up. I can move in with my parents while I search for a job, but the thought of that sucks (even though I love them to death). I just feel like a loser. All my best friends (real friends) from high school have their shit together, big boy jobs, and a gf. I am a closet addict, not getting any younger, with no significant other, or no real plans for the future. \n\n\nI feel like throughout my use I lost the meaning of life. Sometimes I don't even see why I am alive, or what I am working towards because I don't seem to care about any of it. I have contemplated suicide, and the thoughts seem to be occurring more often than not. There have been times where I would pop xanax with my opiates thinking idc if I wake up as I drift into sleep. I just can't do that to my family, as much as it would be a relief to me. Sure, I'd love to have a family, kids, a nice home, and whatever else the american dream is... But , in reality I don't feel like that is possible for me.  \n\n\nI also have sleeping issues. I literally need a substance to put me to sleep, and this has been a problem before my use started. I am scripted Ambien, but that just ran out. My health insurance runs out in 29 days, and I will be without until I get a job that provides one. Some of you might say I have it good. But I promise you I would trade anything I have to just be happy with myself. \n\n\nOpiates fucked up my brain permanently. I have taken them since I was 16 (25 now), when I had no clue what withdrawals were. I had no idea what I was doing to the wiring of my brain. My usage progressed slowly, and my tolerance got bigger as time went one. When I started snorting dope for a few months, it just skyrocketed my tolerance once I went back to pharms. I just can't deal with this shit anymore. I'd love to wake up and cook breakfast, instead of immediately swallowing pills and waiting for my body to stop aching. I am always torn between the quick 4hr fix, or the long-term toss up of hopefully being successful. \n\n\nI am pretty much a daily reader of this sub. I have an alt account, but I wouldn't want to post this sob story on my real account. I guess I am just a pussy, and too worried about where I should be in life instead of just taking it as it comes. I love all you guys, and know that all of you have gone through more than most of what any one in society could endure. Opiate addiction is a bitch. I wouldn't wish this problem on anyone. I wish every single one of you happiness, whether is be from dope, or life itself. I too, hope I find happiness somewhere out there. \n\n\nFor whoever read this whole thing, thank you. I have nobody to share my thoughts with, and I thought typing this out would help. Take care, guys and gals.\n"""

A few months ago my wheezing, coughing and breathing difficulties became markedly worse than they had been before. I went to see a doctor and was referred to a specialist with a long waiting list. \n\nWell, a few days ago, I woke up in the middle of the night and I flat out couldn't breathe. Like, at all. And I hadn't had any dope for about 10 hours, so it wasn't related to that. Panicking, I managed to call emergency and gasp out my address, then stumbled onto the front porch, dropped the phone and started to black out. I could hear the lady trying to keep me on the line but I couldn't speak. Suddenly the paramedics were there and rushing me to hospital.\n\nI was put on oxygen and given blasts of nebulisers every 2 hours, given IV cortico steroids to reduce lung inflammation and given x-rays and blood tests, etc. I couldn't even stand up without losing the limited ability I had to breathe all over again, even with the oxygen mask. They confirmed what my doctor had already suspected; I had Pneumonia, an incredibly rare, nasty type that can be caused by smoking heroin. The steroids worked wonders but it's a gradual process, it's going to take me a long time and lots more steroids to properly recover. \n\nI tell ya, guys and gals, it was a pretty terrifying experience, compounded by the dope withdrawal that set in after about 16 hours in there. Spending a night writhing on the bed in WD in the respiratory ward with an oxygen mask on trying to breathe, listening to the sounds of these old folks in their 80s and 90s wheezing and groaning was a uniquely nightmarish experience and enough to scare me off smoking anything for a while. I'll never take breathing for granted again. I thought I was dying that night I had to call the ambulance, I almost suffocated.\n\nSo I just wanted to give any heavy heroin smokers a heads up; if you experience noticeably bad wheezing, a cough that gets uncontrollable whenever you're not high, and increased difficulty breathing, seek medical attention before it gets too bad, and, of course, lay off the dragon chasing.\n\ntldr; contracted rare type of pneumonia from heroin smoking, had a harrowing hospital stay including WD."""

Does this have any impact on the pharmacology? Is there any clinical significance whatsoever in the type of 'ring', benzene or thiophene, is attached to the diazepine ring? Or is this an physiologically inactive and analogous to a binder/filler in a pill?\n\nLastly, I assume combining 'thienos' with opiates should be treated the exact same way as combining benzos with opiates?\n\nThanks to anyone who has knowledge to share on this topic!"""

3r0evy,store_on_drugs,10/31/2015 16:19:42,b'Policy Question',"b""Hey all,\n    Not a user myself but I am trying to form an educated stance on drug policy and I figure input from current users might be a helpful thing to consider.  My opinion, so far, is that all recreational drugs should be legalized and regulated by the government.  Marijuana is fairly easy to agree on and it's clear that it will be legal federally within 10 years.  Heroin, on the other hand, is not even considered by the mainstream as something that should be legalized.  The reason why I believe it should be legalized is its illegality is not an effective deterrent.  People who choose not to use heroin (such as myself) choose not to because of the consequences of addiction, health risks, etc., not because it's illegal.  Instead of imprisoning users, we should offer treatment for people who are addicted if they want it.  Also, the sale of this drug by the government would eliminate scumbags who cut the drug with rat poison to turn a higher profit.  Also, this would undercut the current suppliers who use violent practices to get rid of resistance and competition.  As consumers of heroin, without being too selfish and actually thinking about the greater good of society, what bad impacts might I be overlooking?  Or is this actually a good idea that you agree with?"""

So naturally I'm out by 12 PM yesterday and WD's usually start to set in around 10-12 hours after my last shot (I know, fucked right?) but I REALLY don't want to use any subs because this stuff is supposed to be super dank, which it is by the way, and I don't want to have to wait to use it so instead I decide to distract myself and kill time since I can't sleep by IMing the gram of ketamine I got from my last shipment throughout the night. \nHOLY FUCKING SHITS\nNow this guy has always given the best K but he warned me about this particular batch which I did my best to abide by but I'm a damn spunion and I do what I want. So I start up The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly on my computer and then set my battlestation on the side table next to my bed with rigs, water, everything I need and take the shot to my upper bicep. I probably took around 5-6 shots of this throughout the 11 hours it took for my dope to arrive and the whole time I'm on this rolling hill that just kind rides along with each breath I take. Soon I'm being pulled into the movie and just being wrapped around it while the whole time I'm feeling like I'm in the fucking wild west trying not to get shot at. Except not really because I was having a very hard time accepting where I was and what was going on. When I had the chance and by that I mean when I was capable I managed to put on Seven Psychopaths after watching TGTBTU like 3 times and just tripped out watching that too. Highly recommend both those movies to anyone person who's never seen them, definitely on my list of top favorites.\nAll in all it was pretty crazy night, kind of a waste of good ketamine, but at least I didn't have a clue I was supposed to be feeling sick which is nice. Then to be able to come down on some amazing dope and just sleep all day felt so inexplicably good. I'd definitely do that again.\nWhat's some crazy shit you've done to distract yourself from impending doom? I've also tried smoking a bunch of crack but that just makes it way worse in the end.

At one point I was curious and ordered some amazing BTH from Silk Road and was actually very impressed.\n\nI'd been reading on here what to look for in quality tar and this stuff checked off all the right boxes. It wasn't slimy or dark black. It was a nice translucent brown color that wasn't sticky per se, it was kind of hard and mixed up easily with no heat into a shot the same color and consistency that would be had with the usual Exp.\n\nSo the other day my dboy called to let me know he had something he wanted me to try for him. The only way I can describe it would be hard little dark brown balls. It looks sort of like someone took some quality tar and tried to make it into powder by adding lactose or some other powder and putting it in a blender. The result being small dark brown balls/chunks.\n\nI wasn't expecting much to be honest, but when I mixed it up it didn't dissolve very easily, but eventually did with a little work, but still no heat.\n\nIt mixed up into a nice translucent dark iced tea color with a little residue left behind. I mixed up maybe 0.15-2g for a shot and as pleasantly surprised. It was actually better than most of the tan/white powder going around.\n\nIt had a nice rush and very long legs. It felt just like the tar I was getting in federal prison in California.\n\nHas anyone in the NY area seen or heard of any tar or stuff like this going around? My guy only had it for two days because nobody knew what it was, he said he was having trouble selling it, particularly to the sniffers. I loved it though.\n\nI'd like to get some more of it, but am not complaining because he replaced it was some absolute fire that had me literally nodding standing up last night. I was shocked, I haven't caught a good nod in a while and with only 2mg of xanax this stuff put my dick in the dirt.\n\n\nSo has anyone seen this mysterious tar like dope in the area?

Methadone?'","b'So I did a quick search on Methadone here before posting, but most of them seemed to be discussing the drug negatively; yet they were doing so in the context of trying to recover (especially vs. suboxone; clearly I would rather Subs than anything to feel control over keeping things under control because it works so well for me in taking away cravings. YET (I made a post about this a ~week ago) I have decided that, since I feel so safe and steady on practically jump-off doses and feel in control with the subs, I have been allowing myself an occasional real buzz. I have been in this game long enough to know that habit will almost definitely lead to issues if I don\'t eventually stop, but i ALSO honestly believe that being on subs most of the time, with an occasional supply of blues or dilly\'s to spice up a weekend, that keeps the mind even more satisfied with less amounts less often. \n\nAnyway, feel free to argue about this (although remember I admitted I realize I can\'t cheat the very likely fact that if I continue this pattern I will start having these ""vacations"" more and more often). However, it\'s not the main point of this post:\n\nSince I only use something fun every once in a while now, I try to really get myself something good. I usually drop a fairly decent amount so that I can get quality AND enough quantity to binge for a few days and just have fun before returning to the subs (which has never been a hard transition for me; never had PWDs or bad side effects).\n\nSo I splurged on some OC\'s (yes, the crushable ones; I don\'t think they\'re the exact same, but bottom line is, got myself lotsa oxy. It was very pricey, but like I said I don\'t mind investing a little more than usual for a good 2-3 days of fun. \n\nHowever, recently, I have been constantly disappointed by these ""vacations"" because I almost always end up feeling like I got ripped off. I will admit I was stupid/impatient and took MOST of it too shortly after my last sub dose, but even near the end of my OCs I still was pissed at how little they affected me.\n\nThis is when I started thinking about methadone; something I have heavily researched and know my limits for with some experience. I tend to pick long lasting over short but powerful, and am worried heroin will lead me to needles (which I just don\'t want to put myself through, not that I can\'t understand why lots of people do it).\n\nSo, methadone is long lasting and, what I\'m hoping, potent enough to finally not disappoint. Since I think that discussing methadone as a recreational drug vs. a maintenance/tapering drug are two very different things, I\'d love to get more opinions on the former. I\'m also happy to any info or conversions you want to throw out there, although I feel I know enough about it to use responsibly (especially since I usually start with 5-10mg doses and don\'t redoes for at least 2-3 hours if I\'m not where I want to be.\n\nSo.. what are your experiences with methadone recreationally? Is there a sweet spot or ""less is more"" type of mentality to getting the most out of methadone, like many people believe there is for suboxone?\n\nThanks in advance for any thoughts. I will admit, I am hoping to get hyped up for this (especially since I am only getting a small amount). Also, if anyone who has/had a lot of experience with methadone, how would you compare it to your opioid DOC in terms of potency and high quality?\n\nSorry for the rambling repetitive post, but excited to hear thoughts!'"

I have never used subs before so I am very nervous.\n\nI waited about 15 hours after my last dose. Previously I would last dose at like 11pm but wake up feeling like shit in the AM and cave in to oxy before I could wait long enough. This time I tried taking my last dose at like 8pm so I could get some more hours in while I sleep. Worked great. 11am this morning like 15-16 hours since last dose, I went ahead and slowly inducted.\n\nI got the 8mg pills and wanted to use a real low dose methodology so it was a pain in the ass to break up into slivers. If I need more im going to try harder to get 2mg pills. \n\nI probably took 2.5 mg over the course of 2 hours. A combination of placebo and fear has me carefulling increasing dosage and using my pupils/tearing/chills as an indicator of ""wellness"".\n\nHere I am, 2.5mg sub at 2 hours and it\'s a complete transformation. I feel pretty damn well with no high. My goal is to use the subs sparingly and well spaced out because I am not looking to do a maintenance therapy. I will take smaller doses after waiting as long as possible each time.\n\nUnfortunately, my dosage tracking and measuring is fucked by the size of these pills. ""Tomorrow I\'ll take a smaller rock""\n\nI just wanted to share some of my experience as I was very nervous about this. I know sub is no magic bullet and I shouldn\'t get hooked on it. For me, knowing how much of a waste taking oxy would be right now is very helpful. Once I get past the first 5 days, I usually do very well. The mental aspect of blocking my ability to get high is the best part. Better wds is a side effect.\n\n\n\nEdit: 3 hours after sub dose I don\'t feel high, but I don\'t feel wds. It\'s a weird feeling to be okay but not high on day 1...\n\nEdit: 5 or so hours after sub dose and I feel a tiny bit high. I just feel blessed I can get a few days between myself and oxy. I will definitely use as little sub as possible to keep me from getting hooked and withdrawing.\n\nIf I\'m tapering over 5-8 days from 3mg of sub, should I expect wds at the end?

3qvbnh,swampboy0766,10/30/2015 13:17:21,b'Grammy Dead',"b'I woke up Wednesday morning with a text that read,  Grammy Dead and today I\'m going to what surely will be an interesting funeral. \n\n\nIt started about 2 years ago and I was getting gas , but really looking to score., at a really shady place in the wrong part of town. A car pulls up to a pump next to me and was bumpin some of that old 90\'s west coast gangsta rap. The driver and passenger get out to go in the store and as I looked at these two gents sporting flat bill hats and NBA jerseys I figured I may have a shot at scoring with them. When they came out I was starring that way and gave them the nod. You know, the nod that In my head is the non-verbal signal of "" hey man,  you know where this white dude can score some dope.  I\'m sure these guys actually saw the nod  as what the fuck is this undercover cop trying to pull,  but as they got to where they were across from me , I casually asked  if any of them know where I can get that dog food,  my puppy got to eat. I offered him a $20 spot if he could help me feed pooch. He tell me to follow him but he wants the $20. I\'m fucking nauseated I\'m so nervous and anxious and figured my $20 was as good as gone, but continue to follow.  We go about 2 miles and pull up to this really old wooden shotgun house and am scared as fuck now,  I am not going to lie and pretend Im tough and shit, I was scared as fuck I was about to get jumped, robbed or somehow fucked over and thought about just driving away,  but I was getting sick and desperate so something inside me went on and took the risk. We go inside this house and who is posted up on the couch but his 80 something year old grandmother who he called Grammy. He shouted at Grammy and asked if she still had her meds she got yesterday and wanted to sell them. This poor lady was living on who know what and was selling her scripts she got from the Dr paid for by Medicaid to make ends meet. She was selling a bottle of 90 norcos for $100 cash and I wanted to drop to the floor and praise jesus with her like we were at her Sunday service. I got those 90 Norco\'s a month from her for about 6 or 7 months until her grandson figured out he could sell them for much more and once they raised the price I was not really interested in hydro so I moved on, but every now and then I would get a text where she got some morphine or dillies for something she complained to her Dr about and I\'d go see Grammy and give her some cash. There were weeks times when I would not hear from her for a couple months and would drop in some times and check on Grammy, bring her something to eat and a couple time left some money on her counter. She passed away this week and I\'m going pay my respects to the oldest connect I ever had, 84 year old Grammy  RIP. \n'"

It was rather enjoyable minus the fist fight we broke up. \n\nSo this morning a few of us have our alarms set for 8:30am as we had an early run to make. Gross, right? Well we were really delayed.\n\nI wake up and fix myself a nice, warm shot. I\'m all nice and fuzzy when I want a cigarette. I\'m looking for my shoes and they\'re gone. Huh. Must have left them upstairs. Nope. Now Mexican 1 is awake and he\'s also looking for his kicks. Negative. Weird. Mexican number 2 is having the same issue. Now, what\'s weird about this, is we can\'t find ANY of our shoes. So there\'s about 10 pairs missing. What the fuck. Mexican 1 automatically accuses people of stealing them. But it doesn\'t make sense because my house shoes, and VERY mangled DCs are missing. You couldn\'t sell them for a fucking crack rock. Fuck. \n\nWe tear the house apart and around 9am Mexican 3 walks in. He was gonna ride with us but wasn\'t here yesterday. \n\n""Uhh guys? Why the hell are there a bunch of fucking shoes in front of the house?""\n\nWut. All of us go outside and there are our shoes. FUCKING FINALLY. Except they\'re only the left shoes. And those shoes are fucking ice cold. Dammit. \n\nWe ponder about this situation and hunt all over for our righties. They were in the fucking box freezer. Some asshole stole all of our shoes and frozen them. WHY. We live in the mfucking Midwest and its cold as fuck here. And I wasn\'t putting cold shoes on. They were stuff and I think ice was forming.\n\nI take my blow dryer and get to defrosting my shoes. It actually worked pretty well. I would have put them in the dryer but we don\'t have one right now. The blow dryer did wonders after a good solid 10 minutes. I apparently was the only one with a good idea.\n\nAs I walk out of the bathroom, I hear really pissed off Spanish. And smell something awful. Like a locker room. It\'s too damn early for this fucking shit but I inquire anyways. Before I can even ask, I see a melted shoe on the kitchen counter. Like, the sole had melted and warped. Oh god. \n\n*""wut the fuck happened to that shoe?""*\n\n"" YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO MY 200 DOLLAR FUCKING SHOE? FUCKFACE OVER HERE TOLD ME ITD BE QUICKER TO MICROWAVE THEM TO WARM THEM UP.""\n\n*""you... .  put....  Rubber? In the microwave??""*\n\nMexican 2 is cracking the fuck up and Mexican 1 is furious. \n\n2: ""ESE I said you COULD I never said you SHOULD.""\n\n*""I\'m really trying to understand the mistake you made here, but my brain is literally not processing why you\'d heat rubber up for five fucking minutes.""*\n\n2: ""it was a fucking joke and when I came back from the car, it was too late.""\n\n*""you left him unattended after telling him this? I don\'t know who is fucking stupider.""*\n\nNeedless to say, its been over and hour and were not even home anymore and he\'s STILL bitching about microwaving his own shoes. \n\nTl;dr- its SOUL food, not SOLE food.

She started crying and yelling while getting all up in my face, I tried telling her that she\'s fucking drunk and that we can talk about this calmly and she grabs my face/neck, so obviously I just push her away from me.

3qtaj4,PercoThrowaway,10/30/2015 2:30:04,"b""So I IV 'd Suboxone for the first time an hour or so ago""","b'Preface : Mostly on/off 2 year H user, shooting most of the time, back and forth from BTH and ECP(depends what coast i\'m on at the time). I\'ve recently gotten a sub script (8mg bupe / 2mg nalt strips) but I\'m not getting ""clean"" til January. Still use BTH in between sub doses when I want/can. I\'d say my tolerance to get high/just about nod(even though I don\'t nod off BTH, ever) is about .4g of the ""good stuff"", or like 3-4 bags of some solid ECP.\n\nOnly reason I shot this was because I didn\'t take my sub earlier today(took an 8mg strip both yesterday at noon and noon the day before, didn\'t feel sick at all today/tonight) but I was fiiiieeenndddiiinngggg the fuck out to get high. I don\'t know why, probably because I didn\'t take my sub, but holy shit I would of let someone scream into my ass for hours or scream into their ass for a bit just to get a fix. Random because I usually don\'t ""fiend"". Plus, sublingual typically just makes me feel meh.  Not that I expect it to get me high or anything, but I hardly eat, feel depressed/down, etc when I take the suboxone normally. \n\nSo I prepped about 4mg in a spoon with about 85ml of room temp water. Let sit for about 5 minutes(longer than needed really), mixed up a bit with the tip of a knife. I sadly only have cotton, so I used that to filter. Shot about 75ml. Didn\'t feel any rush or anything. Then felt, idk how to describe it, just weird. Slightly like when you\'re halfway to heroin in a pill addiction and you take your 70mg hydro or whatever, that feeling like 30 seconds before you feel the warmth of getting high. Was not euphoric at all however. \n\nIt did, however, 10000% stop the cravings, and I am pretty content/happy. Wasn\'t hungry before(last meal was about 12 hours ago and not very big), shot up, 15 minutes later the ""high""(not much of one, but better than nothing) set in, then I was eating a fairly full meal in 30 minutes.\n\nIdk how true it is, but I read that IVing it basically makes it last longer(by ""it"" I mean the ""not getting sick for a while"" factor that suboxone, well bupe, has), so if I end up getting black in the next 24 hours i\'ll update with whether I got high or not. When I take an 8mg strip orally, just for one day, I can get a lil high after about 12 hours, and fully high by 18-24 hours. If I take it a few days in a row, I usually have to wait 24 hours but not much longer to get high.\n\nSo yeah...I used the search bar prior to see what /r/opiates had to offer in terms of info on the subject and I didn\'t find a ton and iirc most of the posts are a lil old now anyway(not that it really matters, the formula for suboxone didn\'t change or anything I don\'t think...)\n\nAny other sub IV\'ers? I do NOT plan to do this often. If I don\'t get black tomorrow i\'m gonna try shooting 8mg, then only using it when having severrrreee cravings, or if IVing makes the suboxone effect last longer, IVing when I am low on suboxone. We\'ll see.\n\nEDIT: even though I shouldn\'t have to say this since if you\'re using subs you should do your research/know this already, but for the n00bs : DO NOT USE SUBOXONE IN ANY FORM UNLESS YOU HAVEN\'T USED ANY OPIATE FOR AT LEAST 24 HOURS. For some people, it\'s less time, for a few i\'m sure it\'s more. I can\'t tell you how many pure unadulterated fucking idiots I read while researching IVing sub tonight that said more or less ""Hurrr I IV\'d 1mg sub and I instantly went into W/D! Don\'t try it man! XXX!...oh yeah forgot to mention i\'ve been on a gram of heroin a day for 6 months and my last dose was 12 hours before I IV\'d the suboxone"".'"

Anyone who's experienced it and has any suggestions or conversation would be greatly appreciated.**  \n&nbsp;  \nI just need someone to talk to. My methadone story begins similarly to everyone elses. I was a heroin addict. I was desperate to get off. My ex and I were stealing thousands of dollars from his family to support our habit and I needed something. I jumped onto the methadone bandwagon without researching it. Kept using for a while, but after missing my jugular during a suicide attempt I spent 8 days in a hospital and it was the break I needed to stay off drugs.  \n&nbsp;  \nMy highest dose was 90 mg's and I dropped 5 a week until I got to 50. I then went on a run where I couldn't find any dope for four days and just smoked meth to keep my withdrawals at bay. Finally found some dope once the meth wouldn't do the trick. That only lasted 7 days and stopping cold from 50 mg's with the help of illegal drugs was a nightmare. My original plan was to quit cold turkey, but I couldn't do it. I don't get restless legs I get restless chest with heart palpitations where I have this constant shaking and jumping in my chest and it gives me anxiety attacks. After having that from day 5-7 I couldn't do it and got back on methadone.  \n&nbsp;  \nIt's now a total of a year and a half since I got on methadone and I'm down to 11 mg's as of today. I started my taper at 28 mg's. I dropped 8 mg's first and since then I've been dropping 2 mg's on Tuesdays and 1 mg on Thursdays. So far I've just begun to feel kind of bad. When I'm at work I have little energy and my back starts to ache. I've also had mucus in the back of my throat and minor sinus issues. Nothing I can't handle.  \n&nbsp;  \nI just know shit's about to get real. 2 mg's is a decent chunk of my total dose and I'm doing a very rapid taper. I'd like to slow it down but I live with my parents and part of the deal is I have to work towards a goal. The goal they've chosen? Giving me 6 weeks to get off methadone. I know a lot of this is your mentality and mind over matter but I just know those chest quakes are coming. I can handle the sweats and chills, the bathroom issues, insomnia, aches, all of that. But something about needed to lay down, but when you do having this constant shake in your chest that causes me to jump from my sternum... it drives me crazy. That's what kept me from kicking dope and they've only gotten worse from methadone.  \n&nbsp;  \nI don't know what the fuck to do. I mean I'm going to go through with it but I'm terrified. I want to slam meth so fucking bad I swear I could masturbate to the reaction I get from thinking about sticking that rig in my vein. I'm so scared. Anyone experience methadone withdrawal?

Dad is a Mormon who is a nave about this as one can be. Everyone else has abandoned the situation because junkie brother has ran them off with standard junkie behavior. I am writing this in an effort to mitigate what appears to be a disaster about to happen. Thanks in advance.\nEDIT:\nBeen down the addiction road myself 15 years ago with meth, so I know a lot, mostly how shitty it is to be hooked.  Thanks for the suggestions.  I agree this is going to fail.  I\'m not involved. I\'ve had my advice solicited so much the last 24 hours it is wearing me down. My dad won\'t ""make"" him stay.  Dad has been the enabler, brother is a textbook junkie.  He has already left a rehab the old man paid for.   He is out on bail for Theft (dad bailed him against EVERYONES advice). He has multiple probation violations, and 2 retail theft charges pending.  Dad pays for a nice lawyer, who handles this case wrapping it up nice.  No jail, reset probation, by Dec court date you have completed a rehab, finish your community service by then too.  Well brother is having the damnest time saying sober, he leaves that rehab and goes to a family members home in broad daylight steals the leaf blower from the garagee  And he is stealing everything not nailed down, deceased mom\'s wedding ring, (got it back from pawn!).  So... I washed my hands of it earlier in the week for many reasons. I\'m just watching and worried from the sidelines.  So just to clarify, no ""force"" per se, wouldn\'t surprise me if it occurred later. Brother says he wants this, is not addicted, and needs no pro help,  but he has said that so many times it is just a lie.  I think my brother will be gone to get more at the first chance.'"

He said he\'d give me the money through the drive thru window and I\'d go cop for us and bring it back to him in the bathroom.

Before he came in, a customer walked in the bathroom and knocked on the stall and I said occupied.

I hung up and he called again 20 mins later and told me the cops were called and they searched him but didn\'t find any drugs. They thought I was his drug dealer and they told him to call me and come there so they could fucking search me. They fired him, and he was walking down the road when he called that second time.

Can be hard on stomach so be careful with dosages. -3x a day at 400mg\n\n**Acetaminophen**: Most of the same benefits of Ibu but with more emphasis on fever control and harder on your liver vs stomach for ibu. 3x a day at 500mg (either ibu or ace not both or cut both doses in half if you want to combine).\n\n**Lope**: Megadoses control withdrawal by passing the BBB, lots of controversy on whether or not it actually does but a lot of people swear by mega dosing for withdrawal. I personally just use it for diarrhea at the medical doses. -2x a day at 4-6mg\n\n**Kratom**: This is a lifesaver. This is a natural plant indigenous to indonesia and has two alkaloids that act on the mu receptors. People with a very high tolerance will feel no buzz but will get some form of relief from symptoms. People with low tolerance should avoid it altogether if trying to kick IMO.\n-5 to 10 gram doses 2-3x a day (some people may need more)\n\n**Cannabis**: This doesn't help so much with the physical side of withdrawals but it will definitely help get your mind off of them. Use to get your mind off withdrawals, and indica strains can have a muscle relaxing as well as sleepiness associated. Can raise BP/anxiety for people without much tolerance so usually only regular smokers smoke through wd. - smoke as much as you feel like you need.\n\n**Clonidine**: This is a prescription only med but helps a lot with the physical side of wd. This med works by lowering the adrenaline output, and thus lowering your blood pressure and anxiety a bit. It also helps a ton with RLS. If you can get a script of this I would recommend it. - Take .1mg-.3mg 2-3x a day\n\n**Benzos**: These helps tremendously. Gets rid of some physical discomfort, makes time fly, relaxes you mentally, rids anxiety. Benzos are a lifesaver and a must have for any wd kit. I prefer klonopin for its long half life and muscle relaxing effects but any benzo you can get your hands on will help.- (Xanax 1-2mg 3x a day) (klonopin 2mg 2-3x a day)\n\n**Tianeptine**: Legal RC chem avaliable online. Requires a script in some euro countries. Originally marketed as a tricyclic antidepressant, in the past four years researchers have found it does hit the mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors and many report relief from it during withdrawal. I would recommend the sulfate version. This is kind of like kratom, in the regard that it still has opioid activity but its hardly noticeable and will help you ease off the hard stuff. -100mg sulfate 1x a day or 50mg 2x a day\n\n**Nicotine**: Ok, so this is only for people who regularly smoke/vape but nicotine helps me a ton in wd. The buzz it gives is a nice little dopamine hit and I find myself chain vaping all damn day in wd. Nicotine affects the same pleasure centers as opiates so it helps that craving just a tad.\n\n**Muscle Relaxers**: Another great tool but unfortunately only available under prescription. Soma, robaxin, etc all help a lot with RLS and getting some of those aches out. If you're talking to a doc about getting comfort meds I would ask for one of these along with the other stuff he gives you. I've only had experience with robaxin. I used- 500mg 2x a day\n\nComment on any other meds you use! I'm currently on day 3 of a pretty fucking nasty kick and all these meds are the only thing saving me.

3qpm4k,Lemon_Lightning,10/29/2015 10:04:30,b'I almost died',"b'( sorry if this doesn\'t belong here ) \n\nIt all started last year when I had the most painful toothache I had ever had. At the time I couldn\'t afford to get it pulled out so I went to the next best thing. Ibuprofen and codeine. 500mg of ibuprofen and 12.8mg of codeine.\n\nI started off taking 10 a day, then when that stopped working I started taking 20 a day. In the end I was taking 30 a day, so a whole box. \n\nAfter a few weeks I finally got the tooth removed. \nThough because I was addicted to the pills I couldn\'t stop. I said to myself "" why stop? It can\'t hurt, can it?"" \n\nAbout the start of this year I got down to 15 pills a day which I thought was really good of me to go down so low. \nAround February a started feeling pains in my stomach, which I got every day but I\'d take more pills so the pain would go away. Eventually I started throwing up my food or loads of stomach acid. I lost a lot of weight within 6 months. 105kg down to 73kg. I got stopped by random people down the street asking if I was okay because I was walking like a zombie and was pale as snow. I couldn\'t walk 10 steps without having to sit down. \n\n I finally went to the Doctor and ran a blood test. The doctor called me late that same night telling me to go back in to the clinic the next day as It\'s an emergency. I went in and basically they told me I had an ulcer in my stomach and I\'m bleeding to death and that I need blood transfusions. So off to the hospital I went. 5 days later, 2 transfusions done and 5 days of withdrawling done. The surgeon said "" another 2-3 weeks and I would have been dead"" because I was bleeding from the ulcer for months and months. \n\nGot out of the hospital 2 weeks ago, withdrawals are over ( well the worst parts ) and on medication to shrink the ulcer. So even just one more ibuprofen pill and it will cause it to bleed and be so very painful. '"

First off, I am a proud weed smoker, I've experimented with other drugs, the hardest drug I've done but at the same time I'm not 100% on this but I smoked weed with coke on it that I got at a Crack house, if that wasn't coke then whatever. I've done whip its, codine, oxy, spice, salvia, and I just don't understand heroin. Like I've always seen it as a scary thing, like even now, I just watched a video of a guy oding like fuck man he was close to dying and yet he will still probably shoot up the next day. I have zero intentions of trying heroin but fuck man. I understand it is addictive but that guy was hanging on to life as he slowly leaned back with a blank stair on his pale face, lips blue and he said he could have painlessly slipped into death happily. Like what the fuck?? What is the high like? Sorry if I offended anyone but I've never seen the hype behind heroin or meth or even bath salts I mean unless you actually want to be a zombie lol but for real someone explain the high, the hype, and why you continue doing it knowing you become reckless and are so close to slipping away from your loved ones. I'm not really here to preach I'm not really that kinda person unless I really really feel like I want to let people know how I feel, which isn't often. So like I said can some one tell me what the high is like, why you continue to use, what made you start, what the hype is. Thank you and again sorry if in some way I offended someone \nAnd always remember there is someone who loves you. If you think you are alone, there is someone for you. \nIf you use this because of depression or something like that I'm sorry but take a look at where you are in your life and think about what are you are doing."""

What I can hear is really distorted and sounds either very far off or close up and unexpectedly loud.
