3n564z,thow_away_cali,2015-10-01 15:03:10,Light at the End of the Tunnel... hopefully...,"Hi everyone. Longtime lurker, first time poster. I know that I've been struggling with alcohol for as long as I can remember. When I was 12 my mom put a bottle of wine in my hand for my friends and I to ""enjoy"". 

I'm a recent grad student that has been unemployed since May. I knew going into this summer it would be hard. When I graduated my undergrad in 2012 I was depressed, lonely, and bored to death. I knew this summer would be the same... I hoped not... but I knew. Being alone everyday in my home with nowhere to go, not wanting to spend money, and searching for jobs has become a hell for me. I've been applying for over 10 jobs a week since I graduated. I finally found a job and start on Monday! I can't wait to become busy!!

I realize that this forum has been talking about being ""bored"" but that's a thing! There is only so much painting, writing, reading, TV watching, walking, exercising, crafting, gardening, cooking, baking, cleaning, and leisure time one can do. At least for me, I'm a chemist and time off=boredom. I can't get my intellectual stimulation from home anymore so I drink... /sigh. I find value in work and contributing to the household financially. 

I want to thank everyone for their posts, comments, and advice... I can't wait until I start work so I can work on being sober again. Well, sober for more than a day in a row. I see the light at the end of the tunnel and it's sweet and I'm happy, but it's a dark Thursday. Thank you for letting me vent. Best. "
3n50wt,chewbaky,2015-10-01 14:27:04,New job and making new friends,"I have a new job, in a new country and am trying to make new friends. It's a big office and of course drinking is part of the social scene. I haven't been out with the mates yet, but glad this sub is here and that my circumstance is common enough that I can find people with the same story / issue...staying sober while being engaged with a new group of people who you may be reticent to 'share' everything with. Thanks for being here, mates.
5 months sober (after ~30yrs.) and will not be going back to the old ways."
3n5069,Scotchrogers,2015-10-01 14:22:02,Post Vacation report.,So I just finished up my first vacation since I stopped drinking and I have to say it was pretty great. Every other vacation I've taken all i did was drink even more than usual and show back up to work in horrible shape. This time I feel completely refreshed and ready to get back to it. I got so much quality sleep and relaxation with absolutely no craving to drink. I love this sober lifestyle. 
3n4wtn,feverfor-theflavor,2015-10-01 13:58:57,What is my problem,"I cant even go a week without being sober. I am an alcoholic I know but seriously I am a piece of shit.

I have tried countless things to get sober, I am currently enrolled in an outpatient program and applying for the vivitrol program. 

The thing is I have tried 3 different types of anti depressants, 5 counselors, 3 different treatment programs (satop, AA, and SMART when I was a teen) but I keep relapsing. 

Please redditors who have stayed sober for a long period of time, how? I know the majority of recovering alcoholics say stay busy but that will keep me occupied for a month or two but it doesn't stop the cravings

I sincerely want to be sober"
3n4wgk,larry_sellers_,2015-10-01 13:56:43,Found an old journal. I've been worried about my drinking for longer than I thought.,"I found a journal that I kept about five years ago. In it I used the phrase ""I try to obliterate myself with alcohol so I don't have to think about things.""  That's pretty much the same revelation I had a few months ago, and I didn't realize I had thought it before. 

It was very creepy to read it and realize that I have been unwittingly going in a cycle for half a decade. I'm in a weird place, but at least I know that alcohol and I just don't work. "

3n4up3,CarWashRhino,2015-10-01 13:44:56,Decided I'm done. Wanted to get this off my chest.,"Today after 9 years and some change of my life being destroyed by alcohol and other drugs I am stopping.  I had a bender over the weekend where I must've had 80+ drinks in 3 days and believe I did something of which I am not proud.  

I started drinking at age 17 and knew on my first drink I was an alcoholic.  I loved it so much and my whole life revolved around it.  I got women when I was drunk, got attention from peers, and didn't have to deal with life (how great!). The next few years is a haze of booze, drugs, cigarettes, and bad decisions (that's the short version).    I quit drugs about 4-5 years ago and decided I had to quit drinking daily in some effort to ""not be an alcoholic"".  I started drinking every two days but when I did I did so desperately and then occasionally went on a bender from hell.  The only way I could not drink on my off days was to take Benadryl to fall asleep before I could drink.

I met my fianc two years ago and she changed my life.  I thought I had my shit together.  I really ""controlled"" my drinking and thought I had it together because I only went on two benders each month and maybe a drink or two during the week.  I quit smoking, started exercising, and lost 50lbs but still had this monkey on my back.  I have blackouts and my OCD goes wild to the point that I have convinced myself I've done things totally out of my character.

I've told her about my weekend (I don't even know if I did what I think I did)  and told her that I am quitting drinking.  Pending test results we are ready to rebuild together (she has been sober for 50+ days).  We love each other dearly.  The happiest moments of my life have been when we are together sober.  It's like whenever I drank for the past year it's been against my will... Like I can't help it.

I know I have the tools to be successful.  I know it will not be easy but I am tired of this drink ruining my life.  I've been sober since Monday and I'm not going back.  I'm very afraid but very excited."

3n4m8b,ecky--ptang-zooboing,2015-10-01 12:47:03,Can you stop drinking on your own willpower?,"I've been in rehab for a week for a physical detox. Starting drinking almost immediately after this week, so I applied again to go in. The waiting line is 3 weeks. I want to stop on my own now. They gave me Valium during that week to compensate and avoid seizure and epileptic attacks. Is it safe to do this at home without guidance? Has anyone ever tried this and succeeded? I have the Valium necessary, but I'm still very worried."
3n4ljg,stars_as_eyes,2015-10-01 12:42:27,"Someone suggested making a list, and it's working!","I can't remember who posted it, but one you guys suggested making a list of things you'd like to get done in order to distract your mind from drinking. One of the hardest things for me has been finding new ways to fill the times that I would normally be drinking (especially Friday nights). Anyways, I took this advice and it's totally working for me. Each day after work I pick one thing from the list and spend my evenings focusing on that. It helps to keep me on track and I want to thank whoever posted this advice. Tonight I'm hanging shelves in my kitchen. :)

And thank you ALL for being here! I don't talk much but this has been one of my main sources of inspiration to stay sober. I'm 4 days right now and I'm feeling positive!  "
3n4i8j,thesoberme,2015-10-01 12:20:10,I Can't Keep Doing This,"I wanted to share my story in the hopes that there are people out there who have experienced something similar.  I'm not an alcoholic in the sense of not being able to string days of sobriety together - but once it starts it just doesn't stop.  

I usually go Monday - Thursday evening without drinking but man once I have a work event or to entertain clients I get drunk with them and next thing you know it's Sunday and I'm shaking.  Countless years of excessive binge drinking seems to be catching up with me - I've put on 20 pounds over the last 3 years and I'm just getting sloppier.

On the outside I look like a successful late 20-something with a great job but on the inside I know I have a serious problem that I'm afraid to face because I know it will mean major life changes (career, location, etc).  I'm a seller in charge of frequently entertaining clients which I thought I'd love except I obviously can't control myself (and freak out sober in a bar).

I can't keep doing this shit."
3n4g9d,dearlordbabyjesuz,2015-10-01 12:06:45,Two Months,"Well, today is 2 months sober for me. If you would have told me 4 months ago that I would be writing this I would have laughed in your face. But after 3 run ins with the law, 3 detoxes, 21 days in rehab,  5 days in the loony bin, loosing my career, having the wife kick me out, and not being able to see my kids made me hit my rock bottom. In the past two months of sobriety, my life has gotten soooo much better. I got my family back (still a little icey with the wife but we are working on it. And working on it sober, I am actually seeing postive results), got my job back, I've lost 25 lbs, no more anxiety, no more hang overs, no more shakes, no more not remembering, and the sleep, ohhhhh the sleep. I don't remember ever having such deep restful sleep. I still think about drinking from time to time, not like it was the first few weeks of sobriety, but I take antabuse so I know the consequences if I do drink and that makes those ocasional urges almost laughable. I'm not over confident by any means, but one day at a time I am looking forward to a long lasting life without the demon I loved to dance with. This is a great community. Glad I found it."
3n46s9,Gopherjaim,2015-10-01 11:01:42,"Show off (me, I am one)","Just wanted to show off my flare before it goes away tomorrow. Hope everyone is having a good, sober day. Other than shamelessly bragging I would like to pose a question for discussion. Why does it feel SO bad to relapse? Why is so much emphasis put on the length of time sober? If I were to swear off cookies then one day slip up and eat a bunch I wouldn't feel too bad. Why is it different than slipping up with alcohol?

Thanks for your thoughts and responses. Have a good day e'erbody!

Edit: I mean my flare is turning to 30 days tomorrow. That's what I mean by going away..."
3n41d0,toughtoquit,2015-10-01 10:24:43,7 days without a drink today after 13 years of being drunk every day.,"I came to this sub a few months ago, I was probably drunk when I posted. I got some great advice, but didn't follow it right away.

I started going to AA meetings when I could a couple weeks ago, while trying to detox myself at home.

I drank 1 to 3 beers a night, a far cry from my 6 to 30 beers I would normally have. I also didn't start drinking first thing in the morning, which I had been doing for several years. Then went down to zero beers, a week ago.

I feel OK. I don't feel great, I don't feel bad. Waking up without a hangover is amazing. My anxiety is non existent after the first 3 or so days of hell. My depression is probably a 2 on a scale of 1 to 10, compared to a 7 or 8 when I was always drunk.

I really enjoy the clarity my brain is feeling, being able to drive anytime I feel like it, not worrying about hiding my booze smell, and a bit of hopefulness throughout the day.

It started with me posting here and reading your stories. So I wanted to say thanks."
3n3zj9,daverobbo,2015-10-01 10:11:38,Think I've finally hit rock bottom,"Been drinking since my dad died 10 years ago, last week I won 12 grand on a 25 football accumulator and we'll before that I never really gambled only on snooker but the week before I won that money I'd been drinking crazy amounts and spending 20 to 30 quid a night.

Luckily I'm up from gambling and I've now stopped again I swear its a symptom from Paroxetine my antidepressant and the 10-14 cans of beer I'll drink per night.

Anyway I've not been to work for a week because I've been drinking so hard, I've spent quite a bit on booze this week, I've got bruises all over my body from falling over and God knows what. I think this is my rock bottom. I've never been so alone 
I've always said I'm not an alcoholic I'm just a heavy drinker, the fact 10 years on I'm still telling myself that proves I'm an alcoholic. Today I change my habits I've cut my bank cards up, spilt my beer down the sink and think I'll pluck the courage up to go to AA. 

I can't believe alcohol is legal."
3n3y6p,One_Cold_Turkey,2015-10-01 10:02:07,60 days + German citizenship. I will not drink to that!,"Great news about the new passport and full citizenship rights! On the SD side everything is going ok. No cravings, although I have avoided most social-drinking interactions, so I've not really met the jungle yet. Still a bit bored, still adapting to new routines, eating healthier and sleeping a lot better than 60 days ago. I do not feel incredible different physically or mentally, but then again I have not started to exercise. Looking fwd to the next 60!

Thanks to you all, this community has played a major role in this journey."
3n3wnh,interestedurbanist,2015-10-01 09:50:45,Distraught...dad's having heart surgery tomorrow - but I'm not going to drink,"I'm reminded of when my grandmother (his mom) died almost 10 years ago. My dad's an alcoholic and has been sober for almost 15 years. He made it through his mother's sudden and totally unexpected passing without taking a drink. One of the many reasons he's amazing.

But if he could do that, I can not drink while I am worried sick about his heart procedure tomorrow. It's pretty minor as far as heart procedures go, but it's really forced me to think about his mortality and what life would be like if anything went wrong (not helping: my best friend's dad passed away 7 months ago and watching her go through the loss has made it even more tangible).

I just want it to be tomorrow afternoon, when he'll be out of the OR and recuperating."
3n3w94,theheckfish,2015-10-01 09:47:47,I went to trivia last night and I was actually helpful! :D,"So that's about it, met some friends for trivia and I actually answered my fair share correctly! I used to just be there to drink as much as I could before they were done asking questions. Had some kick ass pizza (I love when places have green olives) and iced tea. One friend knows I've quit drinking but the others don't and didn't seem to give a care that I was just drinking tea. It's great to have fun with people while sober at night, everything I used to do at night involved alcohol. It's also pretty cool to end up with a bill of less than $7 and a safe drive home:) Happy Thursday everyone!"

3n3tzj,UntyingKnots,2015-10-01 09:30:31,Sober Insight,"The whole time I was drinking I believed that I was functioning well, just consuming too much alcohol for my health. Last night I decided to watch a movie that I had been wanting to see over dinner. I made a nice meal, turned the movie on and realized that I had watched this movie when I was drinking and I don't even remember it. That is when I realized that even though I thought I was functioning, I was not. It was a scary thought to realize that I could have done something really destructive to myself or others and not remembered it. I now believe that there is no such thing as a functioning alcoholic - we just don't remember.

3n3qy9,somethingsmartwitty,2015-10-01 09:07:28,Day 2? Feels like day 3...,"Well it's official it's day two, but I feel like it'd been three days since I was awake for so long the past 2 days but I did manage to finally get some sleep. Although I did have night mares of course, it was still nice to get some sort of rest! I am starting to feel better strength wise. Definitely still irritable but it's all passing quicker than I thought it would based on my past experiences during withdrawal which have been worse. 

I downloaded a new video game and played online with friends and had a generally good day watching Netflix. I may have been lazy but I knew I had to let my body recover! I found out there is a job quite close to my house I can apply for which I am quite sure I am qualified for so that also really heightens my mood. 

I'm not even missing alcohol at all. Its like I broke up with a boyfriend that I had a really long relationship with and now that it's over I'm not even upset... Just relieved. 

Going grocery shopping for some nice healthy food and then for some appetizers tonight but I won't drink today!!!"
3n3onm,rehauck,2015-10-01 08:49:08,So I was at the bar last night...,"I'm not very fond of the term ""alcoholic"" but I do admit that I am powerless of my addiction. I've relapsed quite a few times since I joined this sub, but this is the first go around that I've taken things seriously. After I had about two weeks sober I thought to myself, ""You've got things under control again. You can have just one drink."" So there I was, at the bar last night, and like a brick to the face I realized two things:

1. Every time I relapse it's because I think I can handle *one* drink. And by definition, that literally makes me insane.
2. I really don't *want* a drink. Or two. Or three, etc.

I like the way I feel when I wake up in the morning. I like knowing I didn't spend my entire paycheck on grossly overpriced tequila. I like the look of pride my family gets when they see how well I'm doing. But mostly, I love who I'm becoming. And I love all of you. Sorry if you're tired of hearing from me, but posting really helps keep me grounded. :) Have a great day SD!"
3n3j7m,eccentricmaybe,2015-10-01 08:04:26,rationality is not working.,"It is taking me years to see that I'm addicted to alcohol.  I still don't quite believe it (don't want to, mind capable of what is arguably extreme rationalization.) I really am thrown by how confused my thinking is. I can make lists  of all sorts, think about the issue 6 ways from Sunday, and still end up struggling not to drink after I decide it's not a problem (again). I don't want to wait until something bad happens : I unfortunately am very good at only drinking ""responsibly""
  and hiding it and have never had any negative consequences. I just don't seem to be capable of accepting the writing that's on the wall, though I can read it. If it weren't so serious, it would be comical. Why am I hiding something that's not a problem?  Why am I here, worrying, while simultaneously hoping this is just paranoia and I am blowing it out of proportion like when I imagined I had an STD ( I didn't, lol.) It should be obvious to me by now, but it isn't."
3n3ish,Flow_Morpheus_Flow,2015-10-01 08:00:54,"Alcohol, Sports and Celebration...","Alcohol, Sports and Celebration... The connection is huge. And it's something to think about.

Last night I watched the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball win their division. It was a special moment for the team, their fans, and the city. Sweet success.

Such an achievement must surely be marked; it has to be recognized and celebrated in some special way. In professional sports, that means hanging tarps in the dressing room to protect the furniture, placing hundreds of cans of beer and bottles of champagne on ice in huge tubs, and letting the boys go wild; pouring the suds and bubbly all over each other, down each other's throats, and spraying anything that moves.

Interestingly, last night's Blue Jays booze-up had a sponsor: huge posters by Budweiser, congratulating the team, adorned the plastic sheeting covering the lockers, and of course that was the brand on the bottles.

And a good time was had by all. Tears, laughter, hugs, thanks, and a bond between brothers was further strengthened by the process.

And then I wondered... What if I was there?

What if you were there?

We live in a time and place that defines celebration, reward and happiness in terms that make alcohol an important player. It's in the DNA of our culture, our media, our economy.

As we move forward and reap the countless rewards of our sobriety, how will we celebrate?"
3n3fwg,Slipacre,2015-10-01 07:36:22,Last night at the AA meeting in prison - depression.,"I am a volunteer, and so know the joy of hearing the ""gate"" buzz and clunk as the guard on the other side of a wall effectively says, ""you can go now.""

The leader, a man I've known for some years now, said to me before the meeting that last week's reading, which had a mention of depression, had motivated a couple of the men to come up to him during the week - and wondered if it was too deep a topic.

I said, we should try it, and as a result we had what I call a 151 proof meeting.   It was tempered with good news, I announced my new grandfather achievement level, one man got word that he will be paroled in a month, - and then we talked about something that most of them had some deep experience with, something that is rarely discussed - and is important to shine a light on.  

These men know depression, from the wake up in the morning what did I do, how can I have fucked my life up so badly?    
One guy wakes up each day and asks, as he has for thirty some years, ""why am I here?""     
- and then there was a guy who talked about his six suicide attempts, where each time there was someone near or passing who saved his life.  He talked about how his depression had morphed into anger and about the two people who had died as a result of his anger - and who are a presence in his life today.  He spoke about how the holidays are especially loaded in this regard.

Mention was made of seeking help beyond AA, that it was often required, and well worth the effort to break through the shame and whatever.  Many made reference to the boost they got seeing other members of the group - even if just in passing - the fact of not being quite so alone is a step up from the bottom of the pit.  Others talked of faith, and the steps.  

One of the men went on for quite a while, talking about change, and rush he'd gotten from violence which had been an addiction of sorts. (there is a good reason we go through 5 gates to get in and out.)  Some of it was on topic, some, he just needed to talk.  And it was ok.  He actually has come a long way.

Not everybody shared, but they all really listened.  It was quite intense.  Like shots straight up.  There was something very powerful going on in that room last night - it was a privilege to be a part of it. 

preachy bit/ **alcoholism and depression are cousins, perhaps even inbred cousins who are connected in ways they should not be - and can work hand in hand to kill us**       
I have known too many in (and out of) AA who have killed themselves and so it is important to talk about this topic which is still strangely taboo.

But my motivation isn't where I would like it to be. I have catched myself thinking several times ""What if I just stopped taking Antabus?"" - but luckily I go to a clinic to take it, and if I don't show up twice a week they'll call me. It's not much, but at least some kind of a reason to continue taking it. At least I have some kind of accountability.

I try to remind myself daily what good things not drinking has brought. But...

Honestly I'm a bit afraid. I try to stay sober one day at a time, but I can't help thinking about the future. I'm afraid I'll relapse the moment I quit Antabus, and get myself in trouble again. And I'm afraid that I'll waste several years being drunk and unhappy, like I feel I've already wasted about ten years being unhappy because of my mental illnesses. I would like to find the motivation to *stay* sober for a longer time and to be able to imagine a future without drinking."

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire or check in with others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Thankful Thursdays is a weekly thread here, an opportunity to focus and reflect on what we are grateful for **today**.

Writing down 5 gratitudes and 5 acknowledgements daily has supported my sobriety, its been transformational, helping recognise the good in the world around me and within my own actions, and thus raising my mood and motivation. The gratitudes in particular have helped how I experience the world I live in, opened my eyes to recognise the beauty and wonder of the world around me. Theyve been my go-to tool when Im experiencing fear or attitude. It shifts my focus from lack and regret to recognise the abundance and opportunity around me. It is literally counting my blessings.

I frame my gratitudes in the positive, make them about TODAY, make them specific, and they arent necessary big things, they can be really small.

3n2n1u,bathroomgirl,2015-10-01 01:36:54,"Starting over after ""successfully"" moderating","So, I started drinking again a couple weeks ago. Only on the weekends. It honestly never got ""out of control."" No blackouts, no stupid decisions, no drinking on weekdays. But it's still not worth it.

I noticed several changes even though I was drinking pretty moderately. The first I noticed was that my motivation to do things was dwindling. I felt tired and irritable and said, ""fuck it, I'm going to sleep instead"" several times. The second thing is that I was becoming wrapped up in romantic and sexual endeavors way too much again. I noticed it taking up a large part of my thoughts that should be turned to other things. Lastly, I noticed a general feeling that everything was a disappointment. Last Saturday, every party I went to was just *not quite good enough.* Nothing was living up to my expectation of it.

So. After **sleeping too much, not getting a lot of shit done, and not really having that much fun anyway,** I've decided to go back to being sober before I get too deep in that shit and spiral out of control again. I'm really thankful for this sub, where I can look back on my own experiences and read insight from others to help me realize when I'm digging myself into a hole. 

TLDR; The negative effects from drinking far outweighed the positive effects *like they always do* and I'm back to join you awesome people!"

There are no ancients before me,
No followers behind:
Only the vastness of heaven and earth
On this mountain terrace.
Though heaven may know the ultimate,
Joy or sorrow is our own will.

**My Take:**
This is not ""Solitude"" as in ""Solitary Confinement"", alone and isolated.  This is me choosing how I will live my life.  Whatever fate or the universe puts in front of me, how I navigate it is up to me.  I choose to do it sober, and with a positive attitude.

3n2f8e,Trobbits,2015-10-01 00:14:25,Welcome to Oksoberfest! I think we can do some cool things this month.,"So as Summer ended I asked SD for suggestions for names for the next season or month, and /u/_naboo_ mentioned that in Australia they have something called Ocsober which seems to be a fundraiser of some kind.  Sorry for not linking, naboo!  

I think perhaps the word sober is too similar to somber, and I love fall and Halloween, so I wanted something festive.  I am not going to be content to simply choose to not drink.  I am going to celebrate this month of not drinking.  

But temptation is everywhere.  I won't be descriptive, but some of the ads on TV and in stores really do make me think about drinking.  So to steal /u/_naboo_ 's idea, every time I think about drinking, I am going to take what I would have spent drinking that day and put it in a jar.  That would be about $10 a night for a cheap 12-pack at home, or $20+ at a bar watching football.  On November 1 that money is going to my local food bank so they can use it for holiday meals.  

This is not me grudgingly avoiding alcohol.  I am going to see my friends, I will probably dress for Halloween at work, but not go out that night.   I might even slip and drink before the end of the month.  God knows I am tempted often.   But if I even think about drinking in more than a passing way, the money goes in the jar, and I will delight that it will feed families instead of my addiction.  

Anyone who wants to can choose a cause they support, or pledge to do something nice for yourself.  It would be cool if at the end of the month anyone who does something noteworthy comes here and shares a story.  And you don't need to be perfect to participate.  Every day you avoid drinking good things are going to happen.

3n2b3n,Nahalitet,2015-09-30 23:34:11,I've decided to quit drinking!,"Hey guys, from today, I have decided to stop drinking! I am 20 years old, having problems with my family (drinking is not a factor but it helps getting me into depression). I've noticed that when I drink I get in bad mood, am arrogant and not a person you would like to communicate with. I didn't use to be like that but time has changed me. I have noticed that most of the fights I have had with my girlfriend have been induced by the bad mood I am in while not sober...
So yeah, I have decided to put a STOP to that. I count too much on my relationship and family to let alcohol ruin them! It might be hard, because I am in sort of a hole at the moment, but I am sure I am going to make it happen!
If someone can give me some tips or share their personal experience I will be more than happy to read!
Last but not least I would like to say that it is awesome to have such a community in one place and it's so motivating seeing that you are not the only one who has decided to make this life choice. Thanks!"

*What I get from it:*  I've been dealing with this rough spot in my sobriety for a little while.  I have been [struggling,](http://jp8.r0tt.com/l_8f4620e0-f78d-11e1-b3c7-edb239e00008.jpg) and wrapped up in it and only focusing on myself and kind of being a bit of a mess.

Getting out of my own head and [doing things for other people.](http://www.verybestquotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Helping-Others-Quotes-No-one-is-useless-in-this-world-who-lightens-the-burdens-of-another..jpg)  Today, instead of wallowing about my own problems, I asked a few friends how they were.  I knew a colleague was struggling with something, and offered to help.  I read my kid some extra books and helped him with some drawings and letters even though it was way past bedtime.  

Guess who's not thinking about her own problems anymore?  [It's amazing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkyqRP8S93Y) what a little hand holding with others will do for the mind and the soul.  :)

At one week, I feel a mix of emotion. I feel accomplishment, pride and gratitude. I am also wary and anxious, I've been here before and lapsed not to the beginning but to a mindset further beyond previous states.

What is it that sets this time apart? Fear, strength determination? 

I set this time apart! The parameters, the context, my thoughts and actions. I have at my disposal all the tools and the will to succeed, maybe this time I will not give in.

Even if I do, I won't give up..."
3n20w4,stopwining,2015-09-30 22:08:49,Feeling grateful.,"Im feeling so much stronger these days. Im not sure whether its just the weight lifting everyday, which Im absolutely loving, but Im also eating really clean and lean, Im seeing a chiro and acupuncturist for a long-time shoulder/nerve damage which is showing some positive results finally, Im sleeping really well, my digestive system is working like a dream!! (after years of colonics and IBS), Im downsizing my life so my finances are much more manageable and Ive got a cat for company at home! 

Im going to start keeping a gratitude diary so I can remain focused on all the good stuff in life. Even little things, like clean water and access to fresh foods that we seem to take for granted, Im so happy for. Its amazing how much I care about my body now... I really want to love and care for it and make it strong and healthy. Its also a great reason as to why I don't drink. If anyone asks me now, I say I weight train. Most serious lifters don't drink much or at all, so Im sticking with that. Im seriously considering training for bikini model competitions next year (over 45 division). How exciting!!!

Anyway, just thought Id share. If you're in the first few weeks or months, don't give up... It really does start to become clearer and easier and time goes by, one day at a time. A big cyber-hug to everyone x"
3n1w3k,MrLee88,2015-09-30 21:31:22,Reflections on a Drinking Free September,"Today is October 1st.  I did not have a drink during the month of September. It was actually pretty easy to not drink once I made the decision. I woke up from a two day bender and felt physically and mentally awful. I had hit rock bottom again after trying to be a ""regular"" or ""moderate"" drinker. There was only one way forward and that was without drinking. I felt so strongly about it that I knew it would work. And it has.  I am in control of my body and what I put in it.  And I don't want to drink.  Simple as that.  So I don't drink now.

Drinking is a terrible way to spend my time. I have gotten my weekends back.  The weekend used to be about the night, but now I am enjoying the days also. Getting into sports again.  Tennis on a crisp fall day is amazing.  Couldn't play before because I was too hungover and concentrating on the remorse and guilt I felt from all the things I did the night before.   I am getting back into reading too.  I can read after dinner, and in the morning.  Those times used to be shot. I am 60% through Infinite Jest, which is something I have always wanted to read, and is perfect for this time in my life. 

I am trying to think of all the fun things I did before I started drinking and getting back into them.  There was a whole life that I left behind, and I am starting to find it again.  It is amazing. No more hangovers, no more regret, no more dangerous situations, no more losing control.  I am in control of my life, and I choose to kick alcohol out of my life for good. Best decision I have ever made. Thanks for all of the uplifting things I have read on this sub.  Today is a new month, I look forward to all of the ups and downs, waking up feeling good everyday, remembering every day, and the nice feeling of going to bed clear and tired every night.  I will not drink today, tomorrow, or the rest of this month.  This is my choice and it is a great one. "

Also I wanted to thank the person who started the ""boredom isn't an excuse"" thread. All day today I was using boredom to try and justify drinking tonight. 

I'm glad that I didn't."

I don't want to drink anymore, but I'm suffering from severe hallucinations and I don't know how else to deal with it. I've went as far to be interviewed for inpatient treatment, but they didn't accept me, even though i told them i was literally hearing voices that were telling me to jump out of my car in to on coming traffic.

I have medicaid, but it doesn't cover anyone withing 60 miles of me as far as mental health is concerned. I've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety and bipolar NOS, and I can't financially afford seeing a psychologist to get a refill on my medications.

What I have noticed is that my appetite has increased noticeably. Before, I would often skip meals or go for junk food, especially if I was drinking, but now I'm hungry almost all the time. No joke, if there is anything nearby that doesn't have a pulse, I'll likely eat it.

I'm hoping this will level out as I eat regularly and fairly healthy, but for now, the sweet cravings are ruling me. I think Jelly Belly can hire me as their new spokesman with all the jelly beans I've consumed over the past week! "

Last Saturday, I was t-boned and my car is likely totaled. I found out later that night that my ex went on a date. Instead of going to a meeting, I screwed up, got a case of the fuck its and proceeded to go on a bender. Pretty quickly, I realized what I was doing. I have a HUGE job interview tomorrow and I knew if I kept drinking, I'd never get it. I desperately need this job. I thought back to everything I've learned in the past and threw two bottles of wine in the dumpster and called my mom to stay at her place for a few days knowing it was a safe place of love and support. If you're thinking about drinking, call someone before you go to the store. I fell off the wagon but I'm lucky I realized what I was doing before it spiraled completely out of control. I love this sub and the next time I start feeling funky, I'm making some calls and posting here. Stay strong, everyone! It ain't worth it."

I was offered a new job with a 15k raise and incredible benefits. Today they withdrew the offer after looking at my driving record. I am going to try and fight it and explain that my driving record is not a true reflection of myself. 

I just had to vent a bit. Today I will stay sober, and tomorrow will be better because of my sobriety. Someday, with constant vigilance, these mistakes will stay behind me."
3n152f,efrod,2015-09-30 18:12:22,2 years sober today,"It really flew by, the second year. I don't know if I have any new wisdom to share, except to update you all as to what has changed since my last anniversary.

I found a job at the end of December. It was super exciting, I was working in the field I studied for. I wasn't making a lot of money, but it was more than zero so I was grateful.

It became clear that it wasn't going to be a good fit. I was sad about it, and frustrated, but I kept on working because I needed the money. Five months in, I got a call from a former colleague asking me to come in to talk with her about working for her company. This was the job I had actually wanted, and I was able to land it and switch offices. That was a major success.

After I got the job, I proposed to my boyfriend. He said yes. We are planning a wedding and talking about buying a house.

The promises of sobriety are slowly realizing in my life. It hasn't happened overnight, but I have been patient and given thanks for everything I have.

I hope that you guys out there who are struggling with a few days find some hope in my update. Life without booze is not even close to living drunk. I hope that you will do the work to get out from under this. I hope that you can find the support to make it through this like I have.

Let me know if I can be helpful.

Thanks for letting me share."

3n0irz,KissinTheBottle,2015-09-30 15:39:21,Old habits,"Tonight my Husband is out doing his band thing with his buddies. Usually, on band practice nights, I'd have two boxes of beer in.

I'd repeat the process until I fell asleep on the couch. Hubz would return home to find maybe 3 beers left over. He'd only be gone four hours! 
Tonight it's different. No alcohol, a long bath and pyjamas on. I'm unsettled but I know it's because I'm not great with my own company for long periods at the moment. But that's okay; I'm working on that. I feel sad that I would drink so much alone - I wish I could go back and hug the old me, maybe whisper in her ear that she is worthy of love, of responsibility, of self-esteem. I'm actually getting quite emotional thinking about it. If I found out a friend was doing that I'd be there like a shot, but I just didn't matter enough to myself then. It's a slow process. I'm not always great with being kind to myself, but I'm better. It's progress. It's better. It's day 41. "
3n0iih,CenturiesChild,2015-09-30 15:37:35,I'm currently five days sober... but I'm still so terribly confused,"Hey everybody. I'm posting this for the usual reasons, and I'm sure what I'm going to say is something you've all heard before. But here goes: I'm five days sober.

Now, a bit of history. I'm a 20 year old guy from the UK. I started drinking when I was 16 - and since then, I don't think I've ever went longer than a week without alcohol. I suffer from anxiety and depression, and I'm on meds for those. The thing is, I drank too much for them to work properly. My head seems to be in a lot of different places at any given time.

The reason I'm five days sober is this; Last friday was my usual night. I didn't want to go out, so I stayed in. I live with my parents, but I'm an only child and I'm close to them. This being Britain, the drinking culture is quite big. My dad goes to the pub every friday/saturday for 6 pints, and then he comes home and goes to bed. In my opinion, he drinks how you should drink. He never goes over, 6 pints and that's it. My mother, she has a few cans of beer when she's off work but again, she doesn't get drunk. This is basically a normal thing where I'm from (The north of England) and it's all part of the working-class 'life' - as in 'work hard all week, have a few beers at the weekend'. Now, like I said, this Friday I stayed in and drank. I stayed in and drank 20 cans of 440ml beer, and was up til 9am doing so.

This is becoming the norm.

I have a very difficult time saying 'no' to myself when I'm drinking. I'm a kamikaze drunk. I drink til I am unable to. 

I don't like this. In fact, I hate it. But what's worse is, I *do* like the feeling of being buzzed. I just hate how far I take it. If I could be like my mates and my parents (who never seem to over-do it) my life would be much easier. But 80% of the time it's not, and I drink to oblivion. I guess I drink to feel 'normal' - but that's just self justification bullshit.

Anyway - I'm five days sober. It's 9:30pm, so I'm pretty close to six days. I'm proud of myself, and I know that, whatever happens, I won't drink. But because I'm so early into the process and so young - after 30 days of sobriety I may see if I'm capable of two pints of beer, drank slowly, throughout the whole night (but only when I'm out) I will NEVER drink alone anymore, those days are over. But, if I cannot have those two pints, if I feel an urge to go overboard again, then that's it. I'll never drink again.

But when I say this, am I fooling myself? Is my drinking really bad, or is it just 'above average' for my age group? These are the questions I am constantly asking myself, and living in the north of England, it's very difficult to tell if you have a problem or not because 90% of the population seem to. (But again, is this denial and self-justification?)

Sorry for the long post. I know it's all over the place, but so am I. I just needed a place to vent. I will not drink tonight, and I will not drink tomorrow - and (hopefully) when tomorrow comes around - I will repeat that exact same sentence.

Thank you for reading. I really appreciate it.

I'm nervous to stop cold turkey due to my stress ful situation between work and my home life I am single however talking to many girls which i am deciding to start seeing which will in my opinion would keep me away from doing the normal routine that I do.."
3v79is,brittneyintherough,2015-12-02 16:10:40,Ugh,"Now that the excitement of being newly sober has passed I am feeling incredibly blah/depressed. I have no idea what to do with myself, no idea what my interests are and no friends outside of acquaintances made at AA. I feel like I just occupy space and that the only thing I have going for me is that I am NOT doing something (drinking, obviously.) I'm sure I'm not the first to sail through this funk. How did you guys get through it?"
3v77g6,kilayo,2015-12-02 15:57:39,My resets.," I read a couple things here yesterday that got me thinking about my *badge resets*.

 I found this sub 185 days ago while looking for Fitbit info. I was given one and I knew that it was time for me to get my life together. I hadn't ever browsed Reddit before and I came across someone who had gotten a Fitbit and joined /r/sd. I thought, ""I can do this, too!"". 

 I had been drinking again for about 11 months, after I stopped for nearly 2 years. I knew how it felt to be sober. I knew how much better things could be for me. But when I quit before, I just stopped. I didn't seek any support, or do any research, or speak to anyone about it. I was actually very sick (that's another story...) for about 7 months of that time so I was thankful that I wasn't drinking at the time!

Oh yeah, badge resets...! So I use day planners, the kind you write in with a pen because I'm old fashioned that way, and in those I would keep my own counter going. A circled number counting non-drinking days and a slash on days I drank. I was able to look back to 2008 and see that I had many, many, many 'resets'. Sometimes weekdays, sometimes weeks at a time, even up to a month. But you know what? I now realize I wasn't quitting those time, I just wasn't drinking every damn day! 

Then I was looking at 2012-2014, and there was a /! Then three more!! 213 days into the 22 months I thought I had! That's a reset. I had completely forgotten about it. Once again, apparently I had decided to forget things I don't want to remember....

 I did manage to have 417 more non-drinking days before I thought I was cured and I could drink like someone without an alcohol problem. That worked out for me for a few months then I was back to 10-15 shots of cheap vodka every night.

So here I am, 185 days sober, and thankful for finding a post by someone whose username I've forgotten, but I will never forget how they helped me find this amazing resource and you wonderful people. ~k"

No sooner than the hangover from the last bender has worn off does the brain itch for beer begin.  Most of my attempts at sobriety don't go much further than this, I hate to say.

Following the meeting, the kindest of offers was made to me. She said: ""I'm only sightseeing this afternoon in your beautiful city, so if you want, I can come with you to the place and just play on my laptop while you socialise. You know,  just so you know one of us is there if you need. It can be really hard when you start out"". I almost burst into tears at this strangers kindness and I'm so grateful.

I'm not a social person, have zero interest in going to any type of meeting with anyone, so looking for advice.  How do I know if I should worry about detoxing at home?

Yesterday was a BAD day.  Little sleep, but still woke up late.  1.5 hour drive in because of traffic...and from there the day just went downhill.  just being pulled in 1000 directions (felt kinda like taffy at the end of the day), dealing with C-Sats (customer issues), and generally feeling used and abused.

Now most days, this is my job.  And MOST days I can handle it.  but yesterday...it just started out wrong...and just kept spiraling.

Middle of the day had a meeting with my manager who basically gave me MORE work to do. (and personally, HE should be doing it, not me.  But delegating, you know?  Makes you wonder what management does some days....)

and then the end of the day...technically supposed to work OT, but being that I worked through lunch, and I FINALLY  got caught up...I decided to say F-it and leave on time.  Guess what...didn't matter.  Because of a wreck on the interstate, took me 2 HOURS TO GET HOME.

So 3.5 hours in the car...9 hours at work...I was done.  Just DONE.  And if I could have made progress getting home, I would have been able to relax on the way home,  listen to some music, and unwind. but everywhere I turned I was sitting in standing traffic.  And of course, anytime you are in bumper to bumper traffic, you have the assholes who make it worse.  And of course, the enemy, the drunk alko (Pedro) voice starts sneaking in.  Passed SO many liquor stores taking the long way home.  SO MANY....

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

After a LONG day...dealing with stupid traffic both to and from work, and a boss who pretty much handed his work to me...I was DONE.  Knew that Pedro (the drunk-alki voice) was going to start his nonsense, so I did the smart thing.  Called my sponsor.  Voicemail.  called my best friend.  Only had a few minutes to talk.  Other friend, voicemail.  Wife, voicemail.   2 hour drive, with anxiety setting in, nobody to really talk to, and Pedro screaming at me to stop and pick up something to relax at home...it was HELL.  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally got to my hometown, and was almost convinced to stop.  Almost ready to give in...Fuck it, just one.  One glass of Whiskey, who the hell will know?  And I actually tried to turn down the road to my local watering hole....but traffic would not let me over.  So I ended up going straight instead, taking a different way home.  Call it coincidence, call it divine intervention...whatever.  But I truly believe had I turned down that road yesterday, I would have stopped.  I would have bought something.   And I would have downed that fucker when I got home.

Fuck this disease.  Fuck this endless temptation when we have bad days.  And Fuck Pedro, up the tailpipe, with an upside-down Pineapple.

I know I cannot just have one glass of whiskey.  It WOULD have been a bottle who am I kidding?  And may not have stopped there...cause when you are having a shit day...why the hell shouldn't we do SOMETHING to take our mind off it...ESPECIALLY when the voice(s) in our head won't shut up.

 I may have won the battle yesterday, but the war is definitely still on.  Everyday.  But that's fine.  As the song goes...

""We will not take this anymore, we will not ever be ignored...you want a battle, HERE'S A WAR.""  

And I plan on winning this War.  even if I have to tell Pedro to SHUT THE FUCK UP every day...every day I will do so, and tell myself not to drink today.  But DAMN is it hard some days....."

It has not been an easy journey and I feel like I owe each and everyone of you a big thank you. Thank you for your posts, comments, suggestions and stories. Each one of them motivates me and reminds me why I chose sobriety. Honestly, this is probably the first complete six months I have gone without alcohol since I had my first drink at 16. What started as innocent parties and ""beers with the boys"" turned into something that was seriously putting my health and relationships in jeopardy.   I am finally learning to be happy with who I am, and can look myself in the mirror without feeling disappointed. No more digging for change to buy a pint, only to spend the next morning fumbling with excuses on why I was late for work again or why I couldn't make a family function. I am finally able to save some money for the first time in my life, instead of blowing it on a bar tab and hold a steady job with a great company.

Plus my drinking could easily cost me in upwards of $20-$30 a day, so I'm having fun and saving money!

Both seem to do same, so not sure what difference there is.  If I fail this time, I'm looking at detox.  One problem is the last time I was evaluated it was recommended that I do inpatient for 30 days.  This is a major problem since I would not be able to do my job and there is no one to cover me for that long.  They would need to find a replacement.  I'm in my mid 40s and don't want to have to look for a new job, so that stress would be counterproductive.  I do have the ability to work remotely.  Do any inpatient facilities allow this?

I am trying to stop drinking and put 60 days clean and sober behind me, but the withdrawal symptoms are unbearable.  I get through the day fine enough, but come bedtime, my pulse skyrockets, my blood pressure spikes, my hands get cold and clammy, I get restless and the only things that soothes me is a drink.  I am trying to taper off.  I have had some success but it's not working fully and the symptoms described above persist.  I am worried that if I go to a doctor (I live in California) to deal with my symptoms, that I will 1. have my status as an alcoholic put on my permanent medical record and 2. the doctor may try to put me into rehab -I cannot go to rehab for several reasons.  I am privately employed and if I were to leave for a stint in rehab now, my business would surely fail and I would most likely go into foreclosure and have my vehicle repossessed.  

From what I have read online, benzos look like the only option for me to get out of the symptoms without tapering successfully.  I want to get out of this.  I can't spend another sleepless night pacing around my flat hoping that my dad isn't shopping for caskets the next day. 

Thank you for any and all help."
3v6cl0,anonymous_zebra,2015-12-02 12:45:09,Today's the Day!,"Today's the day I stop drinking. My family is coming back from visiting relatives for Thanksgiving and I'm really excited to see them. I've been reading Allen Carr's book and it's helped a lot.

I want to document yesterday so I don't try to romanticize it later: So yesterday, I was super tired and lazy because I only got about 6 hours of sleep after drinking a lot, which is how most days go. I drank the better half of a fifth of vodka last night. I lazily drank cocktails until my stomach finally complained about lack of food enough that I made something to eat. To be honest, I had a nice night but that was from the Futurama, not the booze. I kept making my drinks stronger and stronger and I was chasing that feeling that you never really find. Alcohol is such a lying bastard. I ended up passing out in my La-z-boy and waking up at 5 AM, still feeling drunk and my mouth was dry and sticky. Slammed a glass of water and got some shitty sleep until 11 (I have the day off). 

My digestive system has really been starting to act up lately and I've been having heartburn and diarrhea, a couple indicators that things need to change now. I'm over 200 lbs, heaviest I've ever been in my life. I only work out now if forced to because I'm usually too tired to give a shit. I used to be able to work out and booze but the alcohol has taken over. When I get home from work, I lie and say I'm not hungry so that I can try to catch a buzz before eating. My wife knows it's bullshit. On days I choose not to drink, I either come up with an excuse and go buy vodka or I'm just miserable. There will be days where I'm tortured looking at the clock, debating whether I should get to the liquor store before they close.

Honestly, I would like to get to a point where I can drink a couple beers at social functions, but I'm prepared to abstain totally if that's what it's going to take. On days where I cannot drink due to my work, I don't feel upset or anything. It seems my problem is not drinking when I know that I could. Anyway, I'm not drinking today and I'm going to take it a day at a time."
3v6ar8,SoberWaitress,2015-12-02 12:33:58,"""I don't want to ever feel like I did that day""","I'll submit a more thought out post later but just wanted to check in... I see a 302 next to my name!??! That seemed so unattainable when I first stopped drinking.  But here I am... tomorrow will be 10 months officially.  I rarely go to AA meetings anymore and I only read this sub although I should make it a point to comment more considering how much it helped me when I first began this journey..
Drinking is simply not a part of my life anymore.  Honestly, it's not a central figure in most people's life, but its hard to see that when it is so prominent in your own life... I don't accept drinks when offered and that's about as much as I ever need to explain.  ""I don't want a drink, thank you.""

I'm sitting in the library on campus right now because since I stopped drinking, I've gone back to college.  I'm working on my second degree and should be starting nursing school in May.  

I don't have a lot of big changes that have occurred because of my commitment to stop drinking... but I have a lot of little ones.  I've never been happier in my life.. I don't live a lie... I don't live in guilt and shame... I'm not constantly trying to reconstruct the night before through texts and receipts... I'm not constantly trying to make up for anything I did or said the night before... The resentment and anger has subsided and I can be true to myself...
I sleep well and even if I'm still tired in the morning when I wake up... I don't feel the heavy burden of what I may have done the night before...

I'm truly free... It's so hard to explain and its just one of those feelings you have to experience before you can truly understand...
It's like when you have children... you think you know the capacity of love you have or imagine what it would be like to be a parent.. and then you have a child... and your heart is so full it feels like it is going to explode right out of its chest and it's a feeling you have never felt before...

I'm finally the person I have always wanted to be.  I'm the mother, wife, daughter, and friend I've always wanted to be.  And I wouldn't be this if it wasn't for my struggle with alcohol... although it caused a lot of heartache, pain, shame, etc... I've experienced a lot more emotion than a lot of people and it's only made me stronger.  I appreciate my relationships more... I appreciate my husband more.. and one day, soon... I need to sit down and talk to him or write it down about how eternally grateful I am for him to stick by my side and not give up on me... to understand that my addiction was not my inherent self... and to help pull me out of the darkness with tough love... 

If you're just starting out... keep it up... it will consume your life for awhile... you will notice everything there is to do with alcohol even more than before (hell, I still do).. you will stalk this sub and think about not drinking 24/7... and slowly it will taper off... and you will start living... and the more you start living, the less it will consume you... Never forget where you came from and how easy it would be to get back there... be kind and be patient.

I think most people who think they are ""normal"" drinkers in fact have a problem, it just hasn't progressed enough for them to take action.

I bring this up because most of my friends are abnormal in their drinking and refuse to recognize it. It's their choice and I'll make mine but I think it's interesting that being a person who recognizes this within themselves, though most people have this tendency to some degree, is looked at as strange or abnormal.

It seems common to see posts from people trying to fit in with other drinkers and I think it sucks that it's like that. I am choosing to own that I don't drink and be proud of it. I'm going further than most ""normal"" people are willing to go and I think that's amazing.

Everyone on here should be proud that they are taking a stand against alcohol. Not apologizing for it. If you aren't there yet, I get it and I don't mean anything against anyone. Just know that we all deserve to feel good about this, not demonized. I think that starts with how we view the fact that we aren't drinking.

3v622k,tennesseee,2015-12-02 11:41:08,"Haven't posted in awhile, but I wanted to share a good story.","Just a little background. I promise I won't make it too long. You can look at my post history if you'd like more details. 

I got in trouble with the law over a year ago. I almost got kicked out of school (education is everything to me), I spent 9 weekends in jail, I lost my license, my car, some friends, thousands of dollars, and copped a ""non-expungable offense."" I got sober for six months and then relapsed. I spent several months on the sauce before getting sober again, which I only did because I nearly killed my roommates dogs, got robbed, and almost got kicked out of my apartment, so I felt like I should take a break. I didn't want to.

I am in my final year of graduate school. I am an outstanding student. I have outstanding credentials and outstanding letters of recommendation. The people who surround me think I am destined for good things. 

I am not saying any of this to brag on myself or to brag to anyone else. The reason why I am making this post is because I want to share some good news, and I want to remind everyone out there that it doesn't matter who you are; if you have a substance abuse problem, then you will be playing the game of life on hard mode without any reward. 

I plead guilty to aggravated assault and DUI in January. Because I have a dream of becoming a teacher, my charges present an impediment to accomplishing my goals. There's nothing I can do about that. Since I have gotten clean again I have had a clearer view of reality and have been very insecure about my ability to find a school that will hire me after graduation. 

Here's the good part *I was always told in rehab to share good news or anything for that matter, because even if what you share doesn't really mean anything to 99/100 people, if your message or story means something to 1 person, then its worth sharing* so here it goes. 

 I hold a BS in history with a focus in political science. I am pursuing an MA in teaching, so I take history teaching methods with an adjunct who teaches full time at a local high school. This instructor also sits on the hiring committee for the county (as well as many other things. He or she is a highly involved instructor). Since yesterday was the last day of class I figured I would tell him my story in order to gain insight into the realistic prospect of teaching in a public high school. Long story short he or she put my mind at ease by letting me know that it's not as big of an impediment as I feared. Further, my instructor let me know that he or she is going to tell the hiring committee that I am classroom ready and deserve a shot, if there is an opening in the near future. My instructor went on to say that they will write a strong letter of recommendation for whatever school systems I apply for in the future, if I stay clean.

I could have never had such a strong semester if I continued drinking. Further, my instructor applauded my character. That is the most important part to me. Lots of people in my program are brilliant. My instructor felt that my character sets me apart. 

MY CHARACTER IS SHIT WHEN I AM USING.

When I got sober the first time around, I did so for extrinsic reasons. Those extrinsic reasons are still there, but I have found that intrinsic motivation is much more important for my sobriety. These past two months I have been working on building intrinsic motivation through personal, professional, and character building exercises. It feels like it's paying off. 

If your struggling with sobriety, then we have something in common. What has helped me to short term success has been fostering a sense of intrinsic motivation, a strong support group, and mindfulness exercises. I hope we can all get some good news for the holidays. 

tl:dr stayed sober for a semester and worked on character development. I received a recommendation for a teaching position (if one opens up) because of my character. I have a big heart when I'm sober. I am a snake in the grass when I'm not. Sobriety has offered a pathway to my personal definition of success.  "
3v61m3,HardTacoKit,2015-12-02 11:38:11,"Alcohol is the Cause, not the Effect","I used to think my drinking was the EFFECT of my life... that I was angry, or anxious, or something bad (or good) happened... so I drank.

Now I know that I drank because I am an alcoholic.   And that drinking is a CAUSE of being angry or anxious or bad things happening AFTER I drink.

When I take away the drink, I can live life.   Bad things will still happen, but I'll be able to react to them in a human way.

My body after 3 months of sobriety (young male shirtless),"The before picture was taken after I laid out on the beach for about 4 hours and got extremely burnt. Of course I was drinking heavily that day (around 11am to 3pm). I was so disgusted with how puffy and bloated I looked, but NEEDED to take a picture to give me motivation to quit. That was about September 6 and I think I was around 195 lb.

The After picture was taken yesterday or the day before and I'm around 185 lb. I've been hitting the gym religiously and love it. I only lift, so I figure I probably lost like 17 lb of fat/excess water and gained about 7lb muscle. It might not seem like too much of a difference but I feel so much better. :)

My dad is an alcoholic who my mom divorced 18 years ago (I hardly see him anymore), my dad's dad was an alcoholic which lead to my dad becoming involved in alcoholism. 


Now I feel like I'm going down the same route and have to stop, I've had instances where I've felt like I should stop drinking but haven't for an example; I threw a bottle of beer in rage which nearly hit my girlfriend (didn't know she was there), I got involved in a domestic between two other people, I've been chucked out of almost every bar and club in my area. 


But on Monday is where the eye opener happened that I MUST give up alcohol for good. I was out with friends at the most popular bar in my area and I took a shot which was obviously not what I was expecting so rushed to the toilet, to be sick. Next minute I get grabbed by the bouncer and flung out. Not realising why, I started arguing with the bouncer and he kept pushing me for no reason, I still had sick in my mouth, so I tried to spit next to the bouncer but it hit his jacket, next I know he has got his knee of my throat while his friends kick me (his friends weren't bouncers). He obviously called the police, thinking the police would take my side of the story, they didn't and I ended up spending the night in a cell for the next day to be charged with assault (my first ever criminal charge). 


I'm going to turn this nightmare into a lesson and blame myself for what happened, I will use this event to turn my life around and make it a positive.

Why did I end up here?  It started a while before I relapsed, and manifested itself in many different forms.  I find myself replacing my consumption of alcohol with consumption of something else: sweets, fast food, netflix, video games, anything really.  I just have an issue with taking things too far.

This time around, I am focused on trying to find ""healthy addictions"" to replace my unhealthy/unproductive ones.  One of my friends is a personal trainer, who is now helping me to design set meals for my week, and keeping me stuck to a workout plan.  Also, instead of sitting in front of the TV immediately after work, I have designated an hour to self reflection and hobbies.  I think this will help me to really identify my issues and force me to be unable to hide from them.  

My hope is that by restructuring my trigger and reward systems in my brain with positive behaviors, I can change or eliminate the bad habits in my life.  While I know it won't be easy, I think that deciding to be a little more strict with myself and adding stability will help me to focus solely on the elimination of alcohol from my life.

Not sure if this is helpful to anyone else, but I just wanted to share this reflection and see if anyone else has had similar success with this type of plan.  I will post again with updates on how it goes.  "

I think I knew it wouldn't last when i subscribed to this sub 131 days ago, but it was the first time I wanted to stop drinking for ME. Any other time it has always been someone else who has wanted me to, and it never lasted, I would forget the horrible repercussions and continued to make the same mistakes. I lost my aunt 2 years to this disease, my mom has a little under a year sober, my brother has 11 years, and my sister has 12 years sober. Somehow I always tell myself I am different, I am the one in the family who can control it. What a crock of shit! I am tired of making excuses to drink. 

I haven't drank since Saturday which is the longest I have gone in about 3 years (as before Saturday I would start drinking on my lunch break and continue to do so throughout the day). 

I consider myself a ""functional alcoholic"", I have a full time managerial job, own a home, loving boyfriend, fabulous family, etc. I think I was waiting for someone to call me out on my bullshit but either I have hid it so well, or people were just waiting for me to figure it out on my own. Either way, I am FINALLY ready to do this on my own and for ME. 

I have been in quite the funk the past 4 days, and I know it will pass. Before I decided to give up the sauce I would workout 3-5x/week (honestly, mostly to balance out my drinking habits). Now , I haven't been to the gym in the past 4 days and it is driving me MAD. I just can't find the will/energy to do anything after work except for veg out on the couch. 

Thanks for reading, I just had to get out of my own head for a moment. 

I hope everyone has a wonderfully sober hump day.

At first, I thought recovery quotes & optimism were dumb, but I made myself do it. Slowly, I've been able to open up and actually begin to understand myself and heal a little bit.

My friends and family don't know/think I have a problem, but I know how much I drink, and I know if I keep up the way I do, it will seriously affect my health if it hasn't already. I drink nearly every evening. Some days I will say to myself, no drinking!, and I can get through the night without it, but then the next day I grow weak and drink after work again.

I want to stop completely. I want to take care of my health and find other ways to cope with things that bother me. I've honestly never reached out for help, and right now I feel so embarrassed and ashamed for my drinking behaviour, but I am hoping, maybe, that just reaching out to a community will give me the kick in the pants to make a change for the better.

And yet it is likely that at least part of these thoughts get into our consciousness. An idle thought connected with drinking casually pops into our mind. That is the crucial moment. Will I harbor that thought even for one minute or will I banish it from my mind at once? If I let it stay, it may develop into a daydream. I may begin to see a cool glass of beer or a Manhattan cocktail in my minds eye. If I allow the daydream to stay in my mind, it may lead to a decision, however unconscious, to take a drink. Then I am headed for a slip. Do I let myself daydream?"

3v4ttc,deedeethecat,2015-12-02 06:13:33,My old sponsor,"I had a sponsor when I first tried to get sober a few years ago. She is a lovely woman and I think smashed her head against the wall many times working with me. That is why it was so delightful to meet her for coffee the other day, when she came into town. For the first time in a long time, I had some decent sobriety under my belt!

She moved a few years ago which is why we stopped our sponsor/sponsee relationship and I never got a new sponsor. To be honest, my old sponsor worked harder than I did. I was truly a hopeless case.

The best part of our conversation was gifts of sobriety. I was delighted to tell her all of the wonderful things I have noticed since becoming desperate, or determined, enough to actually get sober.

I had all sorts of excuses in the early days, when I was working with her. I worked too much. I don't have time for recovery. I can't take time off of work to get my s*** in order.

Recognizing that AA isn't for everyone, it really is a benefit for me. But I had loads of excuses for not going to meetings. I'm too tired after work. I'm too busy. I'm not like other people. I'm a special snowflake.

It was great to talk about my struggles where we both recognized the b******* I was feeding myself. And that I'm no longer at that place. I recognize these excuses as my addiction speaking. Since becoming committed to recovery, I took time off of work to do recovery work. I no longer work 12 hour days. Because that does not serve my recovery. I take time in my day to be grateful, to meditate, to read recovery literature, to post and read on here.

Because I trust my old sponsor and because I want exactly what she has, I am going to get my butt to some meetings. I am going to stay in touch with her. I am going to keep being honest.

I am so grateful I have people like her in recovery."
3v4s6r,Lannister87,2015-12-02 05:56:30,I really fucking hate people and when they talk about my drinking,"I'm very angry right now. I didn't drink for a while, and even when I had to reset everything I didn't get embarrassingly drunk. 

However, I made that decision for myself, not other fucking people and their judgment of me or ""appropriate"" alcohol consumption. I still believe that an adult has the right to drink as much as they fucking want and if it has bad consequences on some concrete issue then people affected can complain about it. Otherwise shut the fuck up.


Anyway, I am just doing my thing and today I have to attend something where there will be alcohol so certain people in my family whom I had to hang around today started making fun of me, and how drunk I'll get, and reminding me of some stupid moments last time they saw me drunk. and it's not even anything spectacular, like ""lol, remember you almost walked into a closet/remember what you said, etc""


I don't fucking remember, I don't want or need to remember, I was drunk. I didn't hurt anyone. It's not a fucking unimaginable thing, someone getting drunk. I find it so disrespectful to remind people of it and make fun of them for it, especially when it's something so dumb. They just want me to be embarrassed and feel bad, and it's not fucking fair. I really hate them so much right now. 


The worst is one fucking friend I have who got drunk in front of me billion times who also contributes to this shit and tries to policy my drinking ""out of concern."" It's no concern, it's hypocrisy. 


I really feel like everyone in my life is completely unhelpful and just mean for no fucking reason. 



And today, all this interaction just makes me want to get drunk. Because I can not drink or I can moderate and put an effort into it, and I'll get a pat on the back for being so good this time and just like they want me to be. The thing is, I have every right to get drunk if I choose to. I even have the right to get stupidly drunk, which I don't want to, but it's not anyone else's business. 


It's like whether I drink or don't drink, I am treated with so much condescension from people I should have been able to trust. And I had to hold it in, they don't even know how much they hurt me with this crap. I don't want them to applaud me for not getting drunk as if their opinion fucking matters.



Thanks to all of these assholes now all I want is to get drunk. Fuck people.

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire or check in with others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!
 
---
 
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

3v4gs9,pandapuddles,2015-12-02 03:41:01,What Up Wednesday?!?!,"Hey guys!!! Happy Wednesday!! WuW is where we calibrate our week, check in and see how our SD buds are doing, and support each other in our sobriety.  Share your struggles, triumphs, and general chat-type with us!

**Triumph:** This week has been pretty good for me.  I feel like my anti-depressants are starting to kick in; slowly but surely I'm crawling out of that black hole.  With the fog lifting it makes it a whole lot easier to get other things done.  When I exercise I don't feel as if I am forcing myself to go through the motions and I have to say, I wrote a pretty kick-ass cover letter for a job the other day.

**Struggle:** I'm still dealing with the repercussions of some of my actions while drinking.  There were relationships in which I wasn't very kind to people and some relationships I shouldn't have been in at all.   Lately I've been seeing more clearly just how big of an impact my behaviors have had on other people. I'm struggling to figure out how to rectify that/wondering if I should try fixing it at all.

**General Chat:** I honestly almost forgot it was Wednesday.  The holiday season/end of the year has me working more hours and doing different tasks than usual.  I have been devoting more time and energy to my relationship and trying out new activities with my partner.  Getting out of my routine.  It's been pretty easy for me to get a little off-track.  I've been trying to use reminders and calendars on my phone, prepping the day ahead, making lists... How are you guys staying organized?  What do you do to stay on the ball?"

It was overall a decent time, but a certain friend of mine has made me feel like my sobriety isn't a serious matter on a couple different occasions. She has told me that one drink wouldn't hurt, rolled her eyes when i told her I can't drink, my birthday should be an exception, invites me to go hang out with her while she drinks, etc. She knew me before I got sober. She saw how I had acted. It's really bothering me. This isn't the first time this has happened. I'm 21 and have been asked things like ""how could you have a problem? you're so young"" more times than i can count. People are surprised when I tell them I don't have a court card for AA,  bar tenders are confused when I ask for a pepsi, and when a guy offers to buy me a drink, they are taken back when I suggest coffee.  I'm tired of it. If I were a heroin addict in recovery would I get the same responses?  For fucks sake, if I could drink like a normal person I would, but I turn into a monster. I am a classic example of Dr. Jekyl/Mr. Hyde through and through. There is a reason I got sober this early and it wasn't because I was having too much fun. This isn't some trendy phase, this is a very real lifestyle change I had to make in order to save myself. I was never a functional alcoholic. Some days are a fucking battle, I have to fight myself back from texting someone for drugs or grabbing a bottle when things get rough. I have days where I wish nothing more than to just be a normal fucking person, I'd do just about anything to not crave a substance that's almost cost me my life many times. I have nothing to prove, but if they had saw who I was before, perhaps they wouldn't be so quick to discredit everything I've been through, and the road I have to continue on. Most days, I feel great, but days like this remind me that I am an alcoholic. I'm constantly torn between wanting to destroy myself and create myself. Alcohol is everywhere, and I'm at an age where it's not only acceptable, but expected to regularly binge drink. This is something I will have to live with for the rest of my life. Normal 19 year olds don't regularly go through alcohol withdrawal and have the psych ward in their cell contacts. That's not who I am anymore, and someone I never wish to be again, but I just wish others could understand what I've gone through and continue to go through. Thank you for anyone who took the time to read my rant, I just needed to get this off my chest. Sometime's you just gotta have a pity party."

**My Take:**
Wisdom isn't just knowledge.  Wisdom is a combination of knowledge, experience, experimentation, and contemplation.  I had a 2 year brush with sobriety in my 20's, then fell into the same trap as a lot of us do: ""I'm not really an alcoholic...I can moderate.""
Cut to 30 years later and sobriety round 2.  With the knowledge, experience, experimentation and contemplation (not to mention liver damage) I now know moderation just won't work for me.  

I just want to throw in there that just being old doesn't necessarily make one wise.  All you have to do is watch the news one evening (pick a network) to recognize that there are plenty of venerable dip-shits out there. It also doesn't have to take 30 years to become wise."

3v3vhx,Ecalifornica,2015-12-01 23:58:25,Cure for my Cravings,"I've been in a weird spot for the last few days. I'm coming up on 30 days and have felt like drinking every day for the past week or so. I've been getting into my head, especially at night when I come home and have some time to myself. Feelings of boredom, irritation, and uselessness have been plaguing me. I'm happy to say that I have found the CURE to my cravings, even if it is only temporary. 

I've found that it is absolutely impossible to want to drink when I am extending my hand to be of service to others. I met someone at an AA meeting who needed some help running a winter coat drive for the homeless. I volunteered, even though I didn't really want to help, since I felt like crap. Over the past 24 hours, I have been collecting, counting, cleaning, and delivering coats to the nonprofit organization. We have collected a ton of coats that are going to be handed out at a free lunch this weekend.

Being of service to others is giving me a purpose. It makes me feel a lot less useless. When I'm spending time and energy on helping other humans, there is no space in my brain for self loathing and self pity (feelings that ultimately lead me to drink). It's amazing!!

I'm going to keep up the habit of being of service, because it is helping me while I help others. I don't think any amount of service is too small, whether it is donating my time or simply shaking a newcomer's hand at a meeting and exchanging phone numbers.

For anyone who is struggling with cravings, I cannot recommend this approach enough. It works. It really works. "

For me, nothing really worth sharing -- I just kept the beer low-key and tucked away in a little used corner of a kitchen cabinet my (now) ex never used.  In the years I ramped up my intake I moved the booze out on a shelf in the laundry room or in the back of the garage.  The ""covert recharging station"". I'd hit the spot frequently during the evening to quickly pound a whole can of warm Miller or suck down a cup of box wine and rejoin like everything was fine.  Empties were easy as my ex wife never did housework and it was a chore I usually did while buzzed (at one point my charging station was in the cleaning supplies under the sink).

The hiding is interesting because it was the very first thing that made me realize my alcohol use was abnormal.  It's taken a few more years for the rest of it to fall in place."

3v3pgw,thisisitdoods,2015-12-01 23:08:28,Alcohol makes me feel like a normal person.,"I apologize in advance for the extremely long story, but I've been wanting to vent about this for a while.


I'm 28 and have been drinking pretty consistently since I was 21, but it never really occurred to me how big of a problem it's become until this year. I honestly didn't think much of it the first 7 years, I just mindlessly drank when my friends did. So I won't talk about those years. What I want to talk about is this year. 


I've been a fat guy my entire life. I was a fat kid, a fat teenager, and a fat adult. I tried to lose weight a few times over the course of my life, but I never really got anywhere. Well this February I finally said enough, and started losing weight pretty hardcore. I've gotten down from 252 to 195 and need to lose another 60lbs or so. It's actually been a lot easier than I thought. With 1 exception. I never thought I would be at this point, but eating less has come easy. It's the drinking thats been hindering my progress the most.


In February, during the Superbowl, a stupid incident with my friends occurred that was caused by drinking, and it just happened to coincide with our decision to start working out as a group. So most of us decided to stop drinking. I started losing an insane amount of weight. Like 7-10 pounds a month. It was going great, I was feeling great. My friends slowly started slipping back into drinking, but I resisted for a long time. What I didn't realize, was that it was because I was smoking weed at the time. 


I ended up losing my job in May (the place went out of business), so I had to quit smoking to find a new job. This is when it all started going downhill. i realized that the only reason I was ok with not drinking for those few months was because I was smoking weed. When I'm high, I give no fucks about drinking, hell, if you can believe it, I even start to lose my appetite when I'm high. I don't get munchies, a lot of food I normally like tastes like shit, and all I want to drink is water. I smoked pretty much every day. Hell, weed even helped me start my weight loss journey because it gave me a different viewpoint on how to go about fitness, and made me super interested in fitness, nutrition, weight lifting, cooking, etc.


But alas, I had to stop. Thats when the drinking picked right back up. But not without a better understanding of my life, my body, and my willpower. It started off slow. I would drink maybe 1 or 2 when I went out, because thats what my calories allowed. Then ""oh I can have a few more."" Then ""oh i'll just eat less so I can drink more"" then ""ill just eat less TOMORROW so I can drink more today."" Now it's up to ""fuck my calories, I just wanna get drunk."" 


I realized what was happening, so I said to myself, okay fuck it. I'm gonna stop drinking. Thats when I realized the gravest issue I have. I'm an alcoholic. I barely lasted a week. I immediately recognized why.


All my life, ever since I was a little kid, I've been described and perceived as ""a quiet, shy guy,"" and ever since I was a little kid it annoyed the everliving FUCK out of me. Especially because I never really considered myself as shy. My entire life I've perceived myself extremely different than how everyone else perceives me. I'm not delusional or anything, I know I'm a quiet guy. I guess I just like to live in my fantasies instead of in the real world. It doesn't help that since I was a kid I've always had a strong desire to be a woman, and getting drunk makes me either ""forget"" or ""not care"" that I'm a guy.


But regardless of how I feel about myself, other peoples perception of me remains constant. ""He's a quiet dude."" ""Oh he's just shy."" ""He hasn't come out of his shell yet."" No matter how much I try to change, no matter how much I force myself to NOT be that quiet guy. At the end of the day, I'm still the quiet guy. It is infuriating meeting new people and forcing myself to talk and socialize and push myself way past my comfort zone, and then STILL getting ""you're quiet aren't you boy?""


Alcohol helps me forget that reality. Alcohol makes me feel normal. Alcohol makes me feel sociable. I don't feel shy, since I have no problem talking to people, but I definitely become a chatty kathy when I drink. Part of it is the liquid confidence, but I think the biggest problem is that when I'm sober, I really don't feel like talking to people. I'll be around people talking and I think ""should i say something? nah i don't give a shit, I just want to watch the game."" But when I'm drinking, I want to insert myself into every fucking conversation.


I am literally Fun Bobby from the TV show Friends. He was someone who was dating Monica and everyone LOVED him, but knew he had a drinking problem, so they convinced him to quit. Thats when they realized that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason. Thats how I feel. People fucking LOVE me when I'm drunk. They say I'm the funnest, most energetic person. People go out of their way to get me drunk. They offer to drive, they buy me drinks, etc. Though I am grateful that nobody ever pushes me to drink. They just make it a lot easier to.


So now that I've been trying to quit or at least slow down drinking, it's made me PAINFULLY aware of just how I am when I'm sober. Like I said, my friends never pressure me to drink, so theyre okay with me hanging out and not drinking. The thing is, I hate it. I fucking hate being quiet. I hate being THAT guy. I hate not being sociable. I hate being a bump on the log. I hate being called a wall flower. More than a few times, I would go with my friends to a bar and just drink water, but other than saying a few words, I just sit there, and I feel like I'm sucking away everyones fun. I'll feel tired after a few hours and want to go home.


So I've been realizing that my choices are either to continue my bad habits, suffer being the quiet guy in social situations, or become a total hermit.


The worst part though, is being told I'm a shut in that never leaves his house. I am absolutely ASTONISHED when I hear this because I seriously feel like I go out TOO MUCH and I really need to cut back. If I'm a shut in when I'm going out 3-4 times a week, what the FUCK will I be if I decide to just stop going out? Jesus Christ.


And the thing is, I really do want to be sociable. I want to be normal. I want to talk to people how I see everyone else talks. People say I'm shy, or hell even that I have trouble talking to women. Again, that angers me because neither of those things are true. I have trouble talking to both genders. I have just as hard a time talking to a guy I don't know than a woman I don't know. Also, it's not that I'm shy, because I've known my closest friends for 15 years, and I'm still quiet as fuck around them unless I'm drunk.


I feel like I've been drinking more and more because I realize that alcohol turns me into the person I've always longed to be, or at least part of it. I truly do enjoy people and I enjoy conversation, and I'm at the point where alcohol is the only way I know how to do it. When I'm sober and I hear someone is gonna bring a new person over, I groan, get anxious, I resist. ""Ugh great, another person who's gonna ask me why I'm quiet, time to start chugging beer"" When I'm drunk? I'm fucking begging my friends to invite some more people. When sober in public and someone talks to me, I'll talk back, but part of me gives no fucks about what they have to say, and I just want them to stop talking to me. Even if I do decide to talk to someone, and actually want to, I have no idea what to say, so I just stay quiet. For example, I wanted to ask someone at the gym (who's a really cool guy and talkative with other people and has talked to me before) some questions about his routine, but then I realized that would just open up a whole conversation and I really don't feel like having a full on conversation, so I just didn't say shit. When sober, I'm at my best when other people are socializing and I can just stay quiet until I have something to say. But when I'm drunk in public, I walk up to random people on the street and joke around with them. I walk up to intimidating people at a club and I make them laugh. 


Which brings me to my next point. Yes I realize that liquid confidence is in play, and that I feel energetic, happy, and actually CARE about socializing when drunk. I understand why it's easier to talk to strangers when I'm drunk. But why I get chatty with my close friends is a mystery. Part of the reason I'm quiet when sober, is because I genuinely have very little to say. My friends will be talking about their life experiences, and I lead a pretty boring life, so I don't have much to say. So how the fuck does being drunk (or being high for that matter) make my brain think of things to say? Part of me really wishes that I could just record my entire night of being wasted, so I can see what I was being so chatty about, so that I can be chatty while sober. 


It doesn't help that my closest friends have changed too. We used to play videogames, watch movies, go random places, etc. But now all we do is drink or go to bars. I've brought this up but they just say that we're getting older and they don't care about stuff like videogames anymore, and they work so much that they only have 1 or 2 nights to relax. I'm well aware that I need new friends and am basically setting myself up for failure by being around them. I just have a hard time making new friends (while sober. When drunk, everyone loves me).


So here I am. The longest I've been without drinking since I started again has been a week. It was painful because I went out with my friends and felt EXHAUSTED. But the thing is... I never even really have a desire to drink. If I don't go out, I'm ""fine"" with not drinking. I don't crave the drunk feeling, I don't crave alcohol. It's when I go  out and have to talk to people that I feel like Popeye needing spinach. This weekend my friends and I went to a bar and then back to a friends house, and his girlfriend happened to have a few friends over. I felt excited about it because I was wasted, and I had a blast fucking around with these 2 people who I barely even fucking remember. I definitely would not have enjoyed myself had I been sober, and I probably would have just went home instead of going over.


The funny thing though, is that I don't even really want to quit drinking. The only reason I want to ""quit"" is because it's hindering my weight loss progress. From February to May I went from 252-215. I started drinking again and in June-November I only went from 215-195. I'll workout, eat right all week, and then blow away my deficit when I drink on Saturday. Hell, it's funny. I've been doing worse since trying to make a conscience decision to stop drinking. When I wasn't really trying to quit, I would eat a little less that day, eat better throughout the week, so I would have calories left over for the alcohol. But now since I'm trying to quit I say to myself ""I'm not gonna drink this weekend, so let me just eat normally."" But then 9pm rolls around and my friend who ""wasn't gonna do anything this weekend"" says he's free at the last minute. So we go out drinking and I'm over my calories after 1 beer. 


But other than that, I don't really have much problems with drinking. If anything, this year of drinking has been the best for me. Since I've been trying to lose weight, working out, drinking more water, and eating healthier, I don't get hangovers anymore. I don't black out anymore. I've never done anything truly incredibly stupid while drinking, I've never caused problems because of my drinking, I've never went out of my way to drink, etc. Although I do spend too much money on it. Thats why for those 7 years I never really considered alcohol a problem. Because I wasn't trying to lose weight, and I didn't really have other problems with it other than hangovers. Hangovers were the only thing that always made me want to quit, but it wasn't bad enough. If there was a 0 calorie alcoholic drink, I probably wouldn't be here right now. I guess it's a good thing theres not then. 



I know these are excuses, but they're also things that make it harder for me to quit. Every week I say ""I'm not drinking this weekend,"" but every week I give in because I want to go out, I want to hang out, I want to meet new people, I want to enjoy the weather, etc. But then that costs me a 2k calorie surplus, and a wasted week of weight loss. One of the most true things I've heard in regards to this is ""Theres always a reason to drink."" Thats so true. I would say to myself ""well, this weekend was thanksgiving"" or ""well this weekend was a UFC fight"" or ""well this weekend a friend I never see came down"" and so on and so forth.


I've heard of a bunch of suggestions like get a hobby, join a club, volunteer, etc. Just do things to get your mind off drinking. I know I can do all those things. Hell, I basically already do. I go to the gym, I jog. But like I said, I don't think about drinking often. Hell, even when it's the daytime and I'm at work or at the gym or some place in public, I might dread talking to people, but I never go ""i wish I had some alcohol."" That only comes when its time to hang out with my friends, and honestly abandoning my friends seems like the only solution. I've already been denying hanging out way more than I used to.

I want to go see a therapist so bad, but I have no money. Not only that, I don't want to be drugged, which would just be trading weed for alcohol, then trading alcohol for anxiety meds.


**TL;DR**: I need to quit drinking so that I can lose weight, but I hate being a quiet antisocial awkward guy, and alcohol makes me feel like a regular human being. Every week I say I'm not gonna drink, but every weekend I do."
3v3per,Bomb_Tombadil,2015-12-01 23:07:56,Been sober one day. Could use some support.,"So last night was the first night in a long time that I was sober. I don't know if I could have done it on willpower alone, because I just took sleeping pills to fall asleep so I didn't have the urge to drink. My habit was about a bottle of whiskey a week (as well as quite a bit of weed). 

I'm having trouble staying sober. I'm not sure if I'm physically addicted as I'm not going through withdrawals (unless it takes longer than 24 hours to kick in) but I was definitely using it as an emotional crutch. I don't feel a burning physical need to drink as much as a background desire. Especially considering how easy it would be to go out and buy beer. 

The hardest part is the void that drinking filled. I don't feel depressed or more than mildly anxious, I just feel empty. My problems are now right in front of me and I feel overwhelmed. I know I've made a lot of mistakes and lost contact with a lot of people and I don't know if I can fix it. Hoping to get through another night but I'm worried. I don't want to be ""an alcoholic"". I miss being able to go out with friends (and having friends) and being able to have a drink or two and stop there. 

I guess I just needed to vent. Sorry if this is the wrong place for it. "

Since it was an Open Speaker meeting I decided to go back tonight for a Closed Discussion meeting, which I assume (maybe incorrectly) is closer to a 'normal' meeting.

I felt a little lost, because the theme was talking about the 5th step, so it wasn't what I expected going in. That said, the stories that got told around that step did get to me. 

Something occurred to me during the meeting. Both times I had felt very comfortable and at ease. I was trying to figure out why. 

I don't think, in my entire life, I have ever been in a room for of such HONEST people. We all put on masks, different faces for different reasons or roles, and that's not all bad. The person I am in a sparring ring isn't the same person I am when out on a date with my gf.

But in that AA room, there are no masks. It's just *people*, very often at very low points. 

Maybe I'm rambling. I'm not sure.

But if anyone is on the fence about an AA meeting, I would like to say it may be exactly what you think it is.  I was very anti-AA even 10 days ago and while I haven't *completely* reversed my views, it is making some sense.

It certainly isn't hurting.

3v3j9g,asrhx4,2015-12-01 22:17:29,Struggling..reaching out,"Today's been an exceptionally hard day. I see all of these posts people write discussing all of the great things that have happened once they got sober. Unfortunately, so far for me that has not been the case. Granted I have felt a lot better physically and managed to get into decent shape. But the rest of my life-still in limbo. I'm still dealing with the consequences of my drinking. I've lost friends, an amazing girl, and in the end most importantly my job. Still with no real prospects in the future. I'm trying to stay as hopeful as I can. My finances are wearing thin and I'm not sure what the future holds. A lot of time it just seems bleak. I'm envious of my peers, out there doing what they needed to, working and putting their degrees to good use. They are reaping the rewards they earned and worked for. They are the people who deserve what they have now. I had that gift and opportunity but I chose to throw it down a bottle instead. 

The worst pain is knowing that I'm the only person to blame for my predicament. I don't expect any pity and life sure as hell isnt giving me any. Drinking is not an option, and there is no temptation to do so in my life. I'm just writing this to reach out for support, I spend most of my days alone traveling across the country for job interviews. I just hope it all pays off in the end. Sobriety is the one thing I've promised to myself, but sometimes it feels like life won't let me ever really dig myself out of the hole my drinking put me in. 

I see a lot of posts about how amazing things have been for people once they got sober, how things have fallen back into place. But for me, I also wanted to write this for anyone else who has been struggling. At almost 5 months sober I thought I'd have a better handle on things. I hope no one else is having to face things that I am. Just know you're not alone if you do."
3v3fra,latexyankee,2015-12-01 21:49:58,I'm Scared to stop,"All the usual scenarios that you now sober people had at one time are all ringing true to me.

I wont have any fun, I 'll have no friends, I wont be able to relax etc..I'm 37 male

My problem is that I have hobbies I thoroughly enjoy, I cycle a lot (although the binging prohibits real weight loss or performance gain) I still love to play video games on PC, I enjoy weight lifting. All of this makes me feel good, the same endorphins I get from the first few drinks.

I'm really most worried about the friends aspect. I have a fiancee who is wonderful but she has had a pretty rough life herself (she does not abuse alcohol). She has maybe 1 friend, I have one good friend a one more who is wishy washy. Neither of us have any family local whatsoever. I do have my mother nearby who I see 3 times a month but thats it. So when we don't have the kids it's extremely difficult for us to find anything to do aside from meet a few folks at the bar, thats all my friends really do in their thirties. I've longed for quite some time that we just had a pair of good friends that would meetup for dinner, movie, hiking, anything really aside from the bar. But then we get cabin fever and end up going out, she controls it, I drink 15 or so. I usually dont feel right until Wed after drinking Fri sat and sun...sometimes thursday in the mix as well.

I am just really worried that I'll be depressed as hell and sometimes I drink heavily just because I am depressed that we don't have anything to do on the weekend and by getting drunk I dont have to think about it.We do plan small trips and do outdoorsy stuff when the weather permits but without the kids we have no focus. We both have children with ex's so they are together every other weekend. Its those 2 weekends a month which kill me

don't get me wrong we do enjoy each others company but everyone needs friends. small potatoes compared to most peoples reasoning of being here, I'm sorry. I know deep down this is my mind making an excuse but I cant shake it.

3v3e7i,ShutUpAndLoseIt,2015-12-01 21:38:18,"I replaced addiction with addiction. Long post inside, would love for you to read, would not blame you for not.","I started smoking cigarettes when I was 12 years old. Pack a day by 14. Got drunk my first time when I was 14 as well. When I was 15 downed a six pack and broke my knuckle punching a support beam. Obvious warning sign but I was young and dumb and ignored it.

Fast forward. I quit smoking cigarettes with patches/vape and by April of 2014 I'm off nicotine for good, and haven't had any form of nicotine sinde. Craft beer was already huge in my life and at college partying with alcohol was already a lifestyle and when high percentage alcohol was added to the equation It made it worse. ""I love craft beer for the taste"" it's true. I love the taste.. But someone doesn't eat 3 pounds of chocolate cake because chocolate cake doesn't get you drunk.

I'm now 24, with a bachelors degree. Living with 3 roommates. On paper I can afford my bills, but I can't go a day without downing a six pack. I've replaced my pack a day smoking with a pack a day drinking. 

I know I need help and I know I need AA.

I'm scared to go to AA in my town cause it's so small with a population of 5,000 that some big mouth is gonna tell the whole world I have a problem. I'm single and not ready to relocate and worried I can't even find a person close to my age that can relate to my current state.

My whole family knows I love craft beer and while my close family can see my problem developing, I don't know how to tell my cousins to not buy me that rare six pack for Christmas because it's gonna make my problem worse.

I'm not sober yet, but I'm sure a lot of  r/stopdrinking can relate to this. Respond to this, PM me if you want to. I'm not in immediate danger, but I would love some advice from those who have had this experience. Peace and love.

3v3du4,randomquestion27,2015-12-01 21:35:18,I just have a random weird question,"
I have a random question but this bothers me. I'm sober. (That's not what bothers me.)

Sometimes I like to go out, whether it's to a bar or club - but mostly bars or lounges not really clubs anymore I hate clubs. 

So when I go to a bar, I don't feel tempted and I feel ok, and I'm generally around my close friends who know my situation.

I usually want a club soda with lime or diet coke.  When I ask the bartender for that, a lot of times they give me a big water glass, or a big obviously-not-alcohol glass.  The glasses used for drinks are either thinner, shorter, or both. And I get these big glasses of club soda or diet coke.  I hate this for two reasons:  1. I am obviously not drinking, so fuckfaces approach me and be like ""why aren't you drinking derpaderp."" and I'd rather just *look* like everyone else and avoid that attention  2. It's a stupid big clunky awkward glass.  

So if this happens I ask for it to be in a small glass.  ""Could you put it in a smaller glass"" I ask. But the bartenders look at me weird sometimes. Why? Why is my request a weird request? Why do I have to request not to have a big stupid glass? Why don't bartenders just put club soda or diet coke in a normal small/thin/short glass? Why is it a different glass?  This happens bunches of times, not all the time, but often enough.

It makes me feel weird because 1. I have a stupid glass and 2. I have a glass that is obviously not alcohol, and even though my friends know my situation, strangers ask questions and I don't want to leave the bar because of glasses or questions but still and 3. the bartenders act like I'm weird and so putting them out for asking for a small/thin/short glass why! Why! Is it that weird for me to ask for a smaller glass? Why don't they put club soda in the same types of glasses as the alcohol glasses?  Does anyone else have this experience?  Just me?

I know this is not a very big problem.  I feel dumb posting this. Is there somewhere else I should post this? Is this not a big enough problem for this forum? Just wondering. "

I didn't enjoy them much. They hit my stomach wrong...but yet I still seriously considered having a third. I resisted, and as a result, I began to believe that maybe I'm not an alcoholic after all. I went through a rough time in my life, but that's all behind me. Maybe I can drink moderately now...

Three weeks later, I had two drinks again. A week later, I had four drinks. Three days later, I was nearly blackout drunk.

Since then, I have continued to drink on and off, almost exclusively in secret. Almost exclusively until very drunk, if not blacked/passed out. My old patterns of sneaking around and lying about my drinking returned. I became reacquainted with that feeling of fear and shame that inevitably arrives soon after coming to the morning after a night of heavy drinking. 

Fourteen months of sobriety didn't cure me. Still an alcoholic. I know what I need to do. Holding myself accountable here is only the first step. Thanks everybody for the incredible support provided in this community."

3v2u0i,TheRevCharlieWaffles,2015-12-01 19:11:20,Some anonymous Chinese woman...,"I have always felt that the world is not filled with enough real, human moments. It filled me with resentment and anger that life could be so unfair and so cruel.

I live in Mainland China. This summer was the worst of my life. My breakup with my girlfriend started me on a bender that lasted for about a month. Slowly I took steps to put everything back together and decided one morning that I would start exercising and studying Mandarin.

I took a routine trip to a local mall that afternoon and was approached by a woman who asked if I wanted to learn Mandarin. It felt as if the heavens had chosen my teacher for me so I agreed to lessons. She told me that her name was Cathy and we added each other on Wechat.

It was evident that Cathy was poor. She was secretive about her personal life, wore clothes that were slightly too big and were probably designed for a man, and tried to pressure me into taking a lesson every single day.

Once we began lessons it became apparent that she had never taught before. For an entire hour I would read every word on every page of a level one Chinese book translated into pinyin. She even made me read the table of contents. It was a complete waste of time and money.

After one month of lessons I decided that I no longer needed her services. I made an excuse to spare her feelings and started ignoring all of her text messages. I'll admit it. She annoyed me. I didn't want anything to do with this woman and promised myself that I would never put myself in a position like this again.
Months went by and eventually she stopped texting. Our lunch periods here are 2.5 hours and many people (most Chinese) prefer to take naps. I was feeling particularly depressed and homesick. I think I was in one of my all too common, ""I'll drink and smoke today, eat a bunch of shitty food, and then quit everything tomorrow"" modes. This being the case I went to McDonald's to eat until I became numb.

I ordered my food and sat down facing a row of giant windows overlooking the mall square. My heart sank as I saw Cathy walking towards me. This woman could not take a hint.

She walked over and asked if she could sit at the neighboring small table. I couldn't say no, but now I was extremely annoyed. This was going to be an awkward lunch where I ate as fast as possible and left being polite, but dismissive the entire time.

Almost as soon as she sat down she started crying. The language barrier prevented me from hearing everything she said but she talked about how her husband was away almost all of the time on business. She was left at home with her six year old child and felt trapped. No job seemed right for her. After a few awkward seconds I tried to tell her that life was hard everywhere. Most people feel the grind of day to day life and are filled with doubt. Life is cruel and unforgiving and the game is rigged.

After that I finished eating and left. We said goodbye and she asked if we could still be friends. I told her that we could. Of course we could.

The next morning I received a text message. I ignored it. The next day I received another text message. I ignored it. This woman would never be a part of my life I told myself. Leading her to believe that we are friends is cruel because the blunt truth is that I don't care about her or her problems.

I am a hypocrite. I hate myself. I hate that life was so hard for me and so easy for others. I hate this rich prick, Republican fuck at my school that had everything handed to him. Every time he tries to tell me about the world I want to knock his fucking teeth out. I want him to suffer like I suffered, for him to know the pain that I feel everyday. He thinks he is better than me, but he was born into it and didn't earn a thing. The sad truth is that I think that I am better than Cathy for the same reasons. 

I am no different than anyone else. I am so filled with anger and hatred and I don't know how to make it go away. The entire world will see through me eventually and I will have to pick up my entire life again and start over somewhere new. I was born a piece of shit and that is my lot in life. One day I will start drinking and taking drugs again and I will blame the world for my problems even though I know deep down inside that I am the problem. At the end of the day I am just another miserable nobody trying to navigate my way through the same sea of suffering."
3v2ttq,relThrowaway812,2015-12-01 19:10:00,I'm afraid I may be developing/have alcoholism,"I'm 22 and have been drinking since I was somewhat young (15-16). When I was 18, it was common for me to have 5-10 drinks in a single sitting 3-4 days a week. However in December of 2011 I received a DUI and quit drinking completely until I was 21. 

However ever since I turned 21, I've been drinking very regularly. In the last 6 months to a year, it's been common for me to get drunk 4-7 days a week. I'll generally consume 3-15 drinks in an evening. It's very common for my girlfriend and I to go out many times in a week, and if we go out to a bar, I feel the need to consume much more than I should to have fun. 

At home I generally drink out of boredom, but I don't feel an actual ""need"" it just feels like something to do. 

I never drive drunk or impaired. I never miss work. I never have injured myself or others. It's common for me to have memory lapses, but not full blackouts. 

The only physical symptom I've noticed is profuse cold sweats every single day. I don't have any shaking, headaches, irritability, etc. I don't feel any needs or cravings. 

How should I go about quitting or at least managing it in a more healthy way? I have no qualms about quitting cold turkey, but I've heard horror stories that it could be detrimental to my health. If I set my mind to something, I can do it. I just don't want to potentially injure myself in the process. I do enjoy drinking, but I do not enjoy the side effects."

3v2p72,ChangeItUps,2015-12-01 18:35:29,I am a non-drinker now.,Today I have finished lying. I've finished lying about being able to have one or two drinks. I've finished lying about wanting only one or two drinks. I don't want any alcoholic drinks at all and although that feeling may dissipate my resolve wont. I no longer drink and I am not drinking today. 
3v2m2k,FreeFromMorgan,2015-12-01 18:12:34,Suggestion on saving your recovery history,"For me the posts I make on here and the comments I receive are invaluable, they are a log of the my recovery process and a huge part of working through this. I have been saving all of my posts and the comments so that if god forbid reddit goes away or something happens it wont all be lost. It is also nice because I do go back through my posts on here occasionally and it is sad when someone who left something that was very helpful has deleted their account and the comment is gone. 

I do this very easily with Chrome, if you tell it to print the page you are on and click on destination you can save the entire page as a PDF. This ensures your whole post and all of the helpful comments and advice you received will be saved in a very simple and easy to access way. 

Just thought I would share in case any of you view your history on your account as I do. If you have any questions on this or anything please feel free to leave a comment or send me a PM and I will be glad to help in any way I can. "
3v2llg,easttexasjoe,2015-12-01 18:09:09,My first real try,"I'm a 20 year old guy in college whos making his first real attempt at quitting drinking, my last drink was on sunday when I blacked out after saying I'm only gonna have a couple out of this 6 pack and then went to buy more and more and more until total drunkenness took over.. I'm new to reddit and this is my first post ever looking for help..  I hear its not how much, or how often you drink, its your relationship to alcohol that determines if you're an alcoholic. Ive had my bad times, drinking every day and getting in trouble, wrecking cars, ruining relationships, and ignoring my priorities, I got caught in the myth of ""cutting back"" and it didn't work for me at all, I'm lucky I didn't get arrested again. I hade a revelation the other night and decided I'm sick and tired of being the person I am when I drink and that a change was needed. Being not even old enough to drink and deciding to quit is weird to some people and to myself, but I know from my inability to control myself after the first sip that I am an alcoholic. I'm not sure what I'm looking for on here.. maybe just some folks who know what its like and can understand what most college binge drinkers cant about my situation. I'm also in a fraternity so binge drinking is a really big thing, my brothers support me and I know only I have control of weather a drink reaches my lips or not but if anyone has tips for controlling the pressures of drinking at a party, any help would be appreciated."
3v2l0f,tvplease,2015-12-01 18:05:04,Finally went to AA,"Two weeks ago I stood in front of the doors to an AA meeting and never went in.  Tonight I gave it another go and was able to make it through the door.  As I look back on it now, two weeks ago I still didn't want to admit that I had a problem and needed help.  I'm glad I was able to get over that hurdle. Tonight I'm making a schedule of when I can attend meetings.  Thanks for all the encouragement.  It means the world! "
