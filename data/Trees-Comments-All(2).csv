3n55s3,cvkw9ug,dankinator1,2015-10-01 15:11:19,"Yes. I know your pain. I lost my mom 5 years ago after a lifelong battle with MS, Trigeminal Neuralgia, and obesity from her being non-ambulatory. Official cause of death was Acute Myocardial Infarction (heart attack). It's good she was already visiting the doctor. Heart attacks, while still serious, are not the death sentence they were 30 years ago. Be strong OP. Do you have any aunts/uncles/cousins etc? You need to be with someone you trust ASAP."

3n54ox,cvkvmgd,Justkiller91,2015-10-01 14:55:32,I usually just toss it in my bowl and smoke it (only works if you have a screen).  You could press it into hash and smoke it like hash.

The old school go to is called ""Hot knifing"",  so you heat 2 butter knives until red hot then press the hash between the 2, while using any kind of bottle(cut in half)/funnel to trap the smoke while you inhale.   Or something like using a torch to burn it in a bowl. "

Well guess what, that has nothing to do with the actual goods being exchanged. The violence doesn't happen because of cannabis, it happens because that's how the black market operates. They have no legal recourse to getting fucked over, so they use violence instead.

Take away their most profitable product by making it available in a strictly regulated manner, to responsible adults who can excersize their right to make their own choices regarding their personal health and wellbeing, and you remove a great deal of the involvement of these violent, lawless individuals."

3n4qqx,cvksu6y,DiggerWA,2015-10-01 13:51:07,"as a first responder myself, and the son of a retired LEO, I have never heard of such a policy. LEOs take an oath to uphold the constitution. they are given discretion in enforcement of certain low level crimes. most departments have strict policies on illicit drug use. however, many departments are fairly lenient with off-duty use of certain substances such as cannabis & anabolic/androgenic steroids. I would assume that most departments in California are pretty lenient, as well."
3n4qqx,cvkt53g,Rezingreenbowl,2015-10-01 13:58:18,In Washington state if you get arrested and you have weed on you even if the crime had nothing to do with weed they are not allowed to give it back to you when you get let go because doing so would violate federal law. I asked an officer here and he said all police officers are sworn to uphold federal law.  Hence they cannot distribute narcotics.
3n4qqx,cvktghh,DiggerWA,2015-10-01 14:05:49,"if they were sworn to uphold federal law then you would have been arrested for possession since technically (supremacy clause), federal law supercedes state law. sounds like you were fed a line of bullshit to keep them from giving you your weed back."
3n4qqx,cvku76m,Rezingreenbowl,2015-10-01 14:22:54,"I don't think it's as simple as that.  The way I understand it their first duty is to uphold state law.  So if state says it's legal for me to posses then federal law isn't even a factor.  However there is no state law that says officers are free to distribute marijuana to the public.  Infact just the opposite, state law says only licenced individuals can distribute weed to people.  Those people have to be very trained in the 502 law, and wear a lanyard with an ID card at all times while working.  Hence it would actually be a violation of both state and federal law for an unlicensed police officer to distribute marijuana even if it was mine to begin with.  As a side note you can still be rightfully terminated from employment for marijuana regardless if it's a rec state or medical recommendation."

stayed at the fish hostel by coors field, awesome place. caught a game while in town.

of the shops i visited, i liked botanico a lot, and even though i heard mixed reviews the station right next to the hostel had a couple really nice girls that made the shop... nicer

uber was great, beer was great"

i went all in; edibles, oils, honey, tincture, flowers, transdermal patches

they'll card you at the entrance, beyond that it's like going to a store and buying whatever"

So I could only do meaningless tasks until 10am when I got my second coffee of the day. And then I'd start being really productive after 2pm.

If you are using a coin to help collect kief, put the grinder in the freezer for a little bit, shake the coin around in there for like 10-15 seconds, then take out the coin. The kief you get is the kief you get. If you go overboard and leave the coin in, or shake it for minutes, then yes, some plant matter will get pushed down. That being said, it's easy to tell when that happens because it's easy to tell the difference between kief and plant matter. Please don't spread false information without explaining in detail.

I'm not saying you are wrong about it being a bad idea to leave it in there all the time, but you should put out false information. When used correctly, and not shaken like an animal for 10 minutes, you will absolutely be left with more kief (not plant matter) than if you didn't use a coin at all. 

If it's not a technique you are good at, or choose not to use, there is nothing wrong with that at all. However, there is no need to call it retarded or say that only followers do it or something just because you don't like it.

I guess you are right, to each his own. But when people recommend things like a coin in a grinder or putting an orange peel in with your weed, they are giving bad advice.

3n1oix,cvk223d,frostedponics,2015-09-30 21:04:44,"I'd go longer.  I recently stopped smoking for a week in an attempt to lucid dream more.  Smoked a blunt with a friend the following weekend and honestly can't say I felt any higher or different.

I unfortunately don't feel much anymore (when smoking) after dabbing a bit.  Most likely really depends on how long you've been a regular user for.  I think I'm going to stop consuming for a month to try and break the tolerance."
3n1oix,cvk282y,fliphone,2015-09-30 21:09:31,How often do you dab? I had only dabbed for that 1 week because I had just gotten a gram of wax. Do you think that's enough to heighten my tolerance significantly?
3n1oix,cvk31fy,frostedponics,2015-09-30 21:33:28,"I've been dabbing daily.. maybe a few months.  Initially it was just here and there at friends and I would get way too high.  This is coming from smoking/vaping pretty much every day for a decade.

Once I got my own tools to dab I started mostly daily... mainly because it is just easier to hit a dab real quick then it is to break out my grider, vape, and all the ""work"" necessary to smoke.  haha.

I haven't dabbed in a couple days.  Think I'm going to leave it alone for a bit.  One because my tolerance it screwed up and I can't even get high smoking hoglogs and blunts with my weekend gang.  And 2nd because I've noticed that I'm a bit more off in the mornings now - similar to the day after eating an edible.  

I think your tolerance grows proportionally as you start to dab.  Even as few as just a couple.  My 1st ""baby"" dab had me wrecked..uncomfortable high and certainly wouldn't drive.  2nd /3rd dab were OK as long as they weren't too big.  I've had early dabs that put me to bed almost feeling ill.   Now I just normally do pinky nail size pieces (maybe a hair smaller) and I get pretty high, but never really push past that."

**NEVER consent to a search of your vehicle or belongings.  NEVER!**


I don't care what the cops says or what they're ""going to do anyways"".  Do Not Consent!   "

3n1jwn,cvk0pev,frostedponics,2015-09-30 20:25:52,"Police officers will try to convince you to allow you to search your vehicle.  ""If you don't have anything in the car do you mind if we search"".

They're slick.  They'll try to convince you to consent to search.  The search is legal as you allowed it.  This gives your legal counsel not much to work with.. you OK'd the search.  If you don't consent to a search and they do anyways a lot of times a decent lawyer can have it tossed out on grounds of unreasonable search and seizure.  

So.. if ever pressured to search your vehicle.  ""Because were going to bring the drug dogs out and you'll be in less trouble if you just tell us now if you have drugs""  - DO NOT CONSENT

Don't incriminate yourself and certainly don't do their job for them.  They knowingly agreed to enforce unjust laws when they volunteered to become a police office.  Do no assist in your arrest.


**Tl,dr**:  don't ever give an officer of law permission to search your vehicle or belongings.

3n1jwn,cvk98ts,frostedponics,2015-10-01 01:29:35,"Supreme Court recently ruled on some shit that they can no longer hold you for an unreasonable amount of time while they get the dogs there.  Or something to that effect.  In reality though..doesn't mean they wont take their good ol' time running your license and completing there traffic stop while dogs arrive.

Don't get me wrong.  Sometimes it's best to go along with the officer as far as ya can in hopes that they'll send you on your way for being polite and cooperative.  Spouting off about your rights right away is going to anger the cop & get you fucked with quick, but I'm certainly not consenting to a search of vehicle either.

I've seen it go both ways.  Play nice..admit guilt and hand over your herb hoping the cop is a decent guy and will let you dump/smash it into the roadside and carry on your way.  It sometimes happens depending on the state/cop.

More likely then not though.. you play nice...admit guilt, and then they arrest and charge you (while chuckling to themselves at just how large of an idiot you are for admitting guilt).  They're not trying to get you to incriminate yourself just so they can let you go.


I'll take my chances with the later.. even if out of principal.  I'll annoy the fuck out of them and waste everyone's time just so they can bust me for a gram/minor citation.  At least then I'm wasting their time as much as their wasting mine as they're trying to enforce unjust laws.

It's not entirely impossible though.  A friend of mine got the ol' knock because neighbors deemed his activities suspicious.  Police showed and said why they were there.. a suspected meth lab!

He laughed and let them in to show them his little 600w closet garden.  They laughed.. said they thought they were responding to a meth lab.  They touched nothing .. told him to get it gone and not to make them come back.  They never returned.

Cops can be pretty lenient against weed in Ohio.  Perhaps their initial discovery was unlawful and they knew it would just get tossed.  Or perhaps they just didn't want to wreck this dudes life.  


Other friend got raided with a 4000w garden.. full bloom.  Cops raided when he wasn't home (ex GF snitched).  Met with a lawyer.. was never formally arrested (maybe turned himself in on his terms).. and ultimately ended up with probation only.

I tend to put on the most mellow, slow, smooth, chill music I can, eat a meal before smoking to help control the munchies, and then relax and partake. even so sometimes small sounds set me off a bit and I have to remind myself that I am high and just need to relax.

as to what to start with I would keep it simple. joint, pipe, or maybe bong or bubbler. take a hit and wait, see if you need more or not. edibles are pretty much out for begginers. too hard to predict their potency and how long they will take to start affecting you. you may also want to hold off on activities while high until you know how you behave, and will respond when high.

And it's also known fact that you can't OD from cannabis. Since these statements are true, I don't believe we should ""stop saying them"". I do understand your point of perspective but I would've personally tailored my message as ""moderate and watch yourselves"" instead of ""stop saying the certain things"".

So it seems to me that your the one spreading the misinformation around here which is quite ironic. And how the hell do you expect me to moderate someone's weed usage I'm not them idk how the amount of weed that's given is going to make them feel they could have a higher tolerance and won't be feeling much or they could have a very low tolerance and be feeling it way to much so imo it should be left up to the user because I don't know about you but when I was 16 I was definitely able to know how much was too much and too little. How about instead of moderating their usage you make sure their getting their class work done and getting good grades because many parents can't even do this.

**Assuming the following things :**

* The Nuke contains PURE 100% THC

* It is not immediately breathed in super quick ( Impossible to be )

* The Nuke causes 0 destruction damage

The THC would spread over the world rapidly. People almost instantly would get a heavy heavy dab high feeling for about 5 seconds. After that you would start to feel tired, depressed, upset. Yes too much THC can cause this [See This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGr0ne9FHOM). Then people would possibly overdose eventually? At the very least lose brain cells. A constant 100% THC smoke over the world would cause less oxygen consumption, and likely be similar to that experiment with the monkeys and joints.

Since I assume you are not going to mail over 1/8th here are the minimum sentences you would face if caught: 

**Less than 1 gram:** a state jail felony with possible punishment of up to 2 years in jail and a fine of up to $10,000 

**1-4 grams:** a 2nd degree felony with possible punishment of  2-20 years and fine of up to $10,000 

**4-200 grams:** a 1st degree felony with a possible punishment of  5-99 years and up to a $10,000 fine

Getting high on Vaca Vs. Plausible $10,000 fine and or Jail time.

I say plausible for a reason, from personal experience I know friends who have shipped it to themselves who got caught, and those that have not been caught. I will say this, the guy who got caught, wishes he never had the fucking idea in the first place. Will also add this, the guys who didn't get caught certainly don't hold the memory of getting high on vaca as one of the best moments in their lives.

3v6ku2,cxksxqb,Dem0s,2015-12-02 14:40:04,add .5 grams lecithin per dose/cookie in your next batch. Replace some of the oil with the lecithin. This will help resolve your issues. Make sure you eat something with smaller doses of edibles to ensure proper digestion and absorption as well. 
3v6ku2,cxl05ky,CypressingAway,2015-12-02 17:29:29,"The onset is slow, and depending on your metabolism and GI stuff you might absorb poorly. Lecithin increases the bioavailability by facilitating the passage of THC through the blood brain barrier, but not everyone wants to mess with lecithin.  

How much plant material did you use/how much butter did you make?  
Are you sure you decarbed enough?  

Try eating a half and see what happens.  

Good luck, friEnt."

The pot is just a band aid for a larger issue.  

What you need is to get some therapy and learn to address these types of things for what they are.

A chemical imbalance, in which case you should be on SSRI's and not pot.

Or, its some sort of childhood trauma that you need to work through.

Eaither way pot isnt going to fix them.

Im not saying dont smoke, if you like to smoke and it makes you feel better than fine.  Its not going to hurt you i dont think.

It wont actually cure you though eaither, and from a doc perspective thats what they want to do.

Addictive behavior is defined as using depite consequences.  If youd rather use pot then try and get well, from the Dr.'s perspective she's/he's right and everything they told you is pretty standard."

They aren't mentally addictive in the sense that you'll crave your meds. They will give you some pretty serious withdrawal symptoms when you stop taking them though. In other words, your body itself WILL become accustomed and addicted to these substances. So much so that you might feel your symptoms increase when you stop the medicine. 

The side effects on some of these medications alone are absolutely awful when compared to marijuana. In fact, many of these medications come with a ""Black Box"" warning. I'm on mobile so: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxed_warning

I think you should ask this doctor if he/she is receiving payments from these pharmaceutical companies for pushing these drugs. They can't lie. Or they can... but there's this (again on mobile so sorry for long link): https://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/

Personally, I firmly believe you need a new doctor. I've never had someone I trusted with my medical well-being talk to me like that.

All that said depending on how you're wired cannabis can contribute to depression and anxiety but only you know what works best for you and how it impacts you as an individual.

Turns out my instinct was correct. I told him I used LSD and he wrote ""abuse"". I found this out when I had his notes forwarded to a councilor who asked for them. She agreed with him and I literally laughed in her face, told her to enjoy living in her box, took every piece of paper she had on file and walked out. 

I'm happier than ever because I quit all my pills (not the adhd ones) and started doing acid and weed more. I party and have a social life. The old guard can literally suck my cock and get at me later about ""respecting"" them."

3v62ei,cxkov6x,nugroll,2015-12-02 13:08:58,The vapor is more potent than smoke by such a small amount that you can't even tell the difference. And smoke will taste better and give you that full experience. Vaping just feels like I took a pill that's designed to mimic the effects of weed.
3v62ei,cxkp1wt,TicklesMcFancy,2015-12-02 13:13:18,Well I've heard varying percentages of the methods. I think hand pipes were at 70% efficiency

Also, the high varies depending on time in the oven and amount you grind it. I usually stuff whole buds in (my PAX), hit that a couple times, then dump it out and grind it in my mortar and pestle (much better than a grinder). After grinding and refilling, the high profile is different.  "

After about 3 days of not smoking, it gets a lot easier and it's more of a ""take it or leave it"" type thing. After a week or so, you feel pretty normal again. It's just the first couple of days that can be difficult, because you're so used to getting high a lot."

Blood tests can show up positive as a daily user for 2-7 days.

Unless you caused the wreck by driving like a crazy person, you have nothing to worry about.  Furthermore, daily users show positive for marijuana in blood tests for 2-7 days, so if you had a lawyer with any sense he could argue that it was unlikely you were high at the time of driving.

OP, your post is based purely on ignorance."
3v59qd,cxkkkty,HotterThanTrogdor,2015-12-02 11:30:30,"There have been several articles I have seen recently (I'm looking for a source now) that said after being pulled over for routine stops in a legal state, Colorado if I remember correctly, mj users were tested roadside after the officer ""smelled marijuana"". The citizens who were stopped all denied being high but we're still given a DUI because they were over the limit. Now if an officer can do that after smelling pot what's to stop him from seeing someone who looks like a pothead and just saying he smelled it. I'm not saying cops would do this, but the law shouldn't be written in a way that can punish innocent people. [8]

Edit: from a FAQ on the Colorado department of transportation website I found these:

Q: How can law enforcement determine if I am impaired by the use of marijuana?


A: Colorado Law Enforcement Officers are trained in the detection of impairment caused by drugs. Many Colorado Law Enforcement Officer have received advanced training in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE). Across the state of Colorado law enforcement agencies have specially trained Drug Recognition Experts (DRE) on staff that can detect impairment from a variety of substances.

 


Q: What if I refuse to take a blood test to detect THC?


A: Colorado revokes driving privileges for any individual who fails to cooperate with the chemical testing process requested by an officer during the investigation of an alcohol or drug-related DUI arrest. Any driver who refuses to take a blood test will immediately be considered a high-risk driver. Consequences include: mandatory ignition interlock for two years, and level two alcohol education and therapy classes as specified by law. These penalties are administrative, and are applied regardless of a criminal conviction.

Now idk about you but it seems that if an officer decides they think you smoke weed they could claim they smelled it in the car (it doesn't matter if it's true) and ask for a blood test. You can say yes and get a DUI or no and get your driving privileges revoked. So yeah op has every right to be worried. Let's not throw the word ignorant around when we don't have the facts straight ourselves buddy."
3v59qd,cxktprc,ItsYaBoyFalcon,2015-12-02 14:57:29,"Don't look like a pothead, either let your car air out every once in a while or let it smell a little funky or something.

Before I smoked I had long hair and wore metal t shirts and then in high school, senior year, I started really liking reefer so I cut my hair short and stated presenting myself as a respectable young adult to keep suspicion down. Trees literally took an opposite effect on my life in any way. 

But OP sounds like he does smoke a lot, and if he's like at a [9] hitting 90% THC dabs all day then maybe it is a good idea for him not to drive, when I'm a little stony and drive I'm okay but if I'm super high or it rains I freak out and do kinda dumb shit."
3v59qd,cxl0esv,HotterThanTrogdor,2015-12-02 17:36:13,"I believe you missed the point. You don't even have to look like you are a stoner. It's up to the discretion of the officer and that's wrong. Imagine this: A person has never smoked before decides he is going to try weed. He goes out buys some pot from a dispensary and smokes it at home. After deciding he does not like pot he never smokes again. A week later he goes out for some fast food and gets pulled over. The cop is having a bad day and decides to take it out on this person. He asks if the man has had any drinks or drugs today. The man says no but the officer isn't satisfied. He, under the claim he smelled weed in the vehicle, makes the man get out of the car and submit to a blood test. The man is fucked. 

Even if the cop wasn't being an asshole and really did think he smelled weed in the car the law still tucks over the citizen who has done nothing wrong."

Maybe there are specific laws that you do not have a better grasp in. Ignorance to me is ignoring the risk. There could be all the information in the world that you could or couldn't know about driving while high, but there is still a risk that, on a whole as a society, needs to be better analyzed and until then, we should take precaution.

It's from an aritcle at merryjane.com so maybe take it with a grain  of salt, I'm just passing on any helpful info here. I'm Pretty sure you need to have an account to get to the articles but the snippet is:

    Things we take for granted in our home countries can land you in hot water elsewhere in the world. In South Korea, pot is illegal in any amount and the worst part is - you dont even have to have it on you to get charged with possession. Police have been known to raid nightclubs and perform hair and urine tests on-the-spot. If you test positive for THC, you can expect some serious prison time (up to 5 years). Talk about a real party crasher
    
    Marijuana is completely taboo here and even talking about it to a local will most likely result in a phone call to the police. South Koreas massive police force openly patrol parks, neighborhoods, and everywhere in between. While visiting South Korea, try to remember that youre a guest in someone elses country, so dont be that guy

3v51t6,cxkd536,MyHeroesWearSteeltoe,2015-12-02 08:11:39,"Here is the quick and dirty, At 14 I got caught at school and expelled. Dad whooped my ass bad. Got caught a few more times and whooped and told to snitch or get it again. I got it again. Decided weed was too easy to get caught for and I had issues with it giving anxiety and exacerbating my depression, so I turned to opiates. No smell, easy to conceal. I carried on as a junkie for years. I am 28 now and nearly had a fatal od in August. I have since returned to the tree. And my family is chill with it. My dad gave me some of his weed, and his grinder. I hold more anger and resentment for what he did and the way he handled me getting caught than I can ever express. But to stay sober, I have to let it go."

Eventually they just kind of accepted it and I'm open about it. 

My mom has very bad arthritis and has talked from time to time about smoking to help her pain management. She smoked back in her day but stopped after she began hating the paranoia. 

As of this Thanksgiving she smoked with my sister and I. I had rolled a blunt that evening and was going outside to light up. She stops us as we're putting our shoes on and asks what we're doing. I want some. So we sit at the table and smoke. It was nice. Weird but nice. "

As the smoke left I saw him just standing there staring at me, we just locked eyes for a couple of seconds in the darkness then I popped my head back in and he went inside.

She knows that it's just something college students do and isn't a bad thing unless I get caught.

I had no time to clean it and there was trash everywhere, her son offered to clean it for me so I said sure and thanked him. Now I knew the kid had a knack for lying and making shit up but the little shit went to his mom and my dad and told them he found a joint in my truck, first there was no joint there bc I never once smoked in that truck. My dad confronted me about it and I said no there was no way( he knows my gf smokes) he then asked if it could have been my gfs and it fell out of her purse. Scrambling now and trying to keep myself from telling my dad that I do smoke I made some shit up and said dad nobody even smokes joints anymore, yea that's what I hit him with, without missing a beat he fires back with so what do you use a bowl? I stood there dumb founded and the only thing I could come up with in response was I plead the fifth.  He asked if my mom knew and I said yea, she had found out a couple weeks before and really didn't care she even wanted to smoke with me. I think hearing how well my mom took it he didn't yell or anything. Since then it's kinda been like a don't ask don't tell thing, he knows I do it but we don't talk about it."

My parents asked me about it. I said it wasn't mine (which was true) but that I had tried it. My brother eventually had a couple more close calls and finally admitted he smokes to my parents about a year ago. My parents know I do it just not how frequently. We live in Oregon so this past year has been interesting. My parents aren't super judgemental about it and are considering trying it for the medicinal effects."

The science is shaky, but evidently you should undertake self administered cognitive behavourial therapy (do memory strengthening exercises, literally test and push your memory), and cut back or stop smoking, at least temporarily. I think the bigger the break the better at the moment, but failing that try to have intermittent, 24 hour breaks. All the while keep trying to strengthen your memory.

I also had a lot of friends who worked the graveyard shift so they would come out and we'd all smoke in the dumpster corral with all the employees, including the manager.

I remember one particular night we got a bunch of free cold, stale nuggets. So my friend who worked there, we'll call him Ty, grabbed his katana out of his car, which he had because he was in the process of moving/getting kicked out by his parents. So Ty brandishes the blade as we all toss nuggets into the air and he makes quick work of at least three of them in a few settings, cutting them clean in half.

I've never come across anyone in real life who is/was ok with smoking and driving or drinking and driving. Even when I was a teenager I knew that shit wasn't even close to ok. 

They've decided the risks are acceptable, but they're making that choice for everyone else on the road with them. I like living and I already have enough medical problems to worry about to risk anything over something so completely ridiculous as being unable to consider getting a bus, taxi, delivery food or organising your munchies before hand. 
"
3v44l9,cxkk83c,nobruh420,2015-12-02 11:22:16," I also reacted the same way as you. Like what the fuck, they're too high to walk in a store to order food, but they're not too high to operate a 1 ton piece of metal on the road with innocent people?! "

You might think it's useless but if everyone wasn't acting like this is completely fine and normal to do then maybe they'd realise that being a complete and utterly irresponsible ass isn't a good thing.

If they want to drive while stoned where there are no people around good for them, go for it, if they crash and die or end up paralysed, or even just end up fucking up their car, well, it was their choice and no one else gets injured. Otherwise take the fucking bus, get food delivered or, go buy your food first then go somewhere to get stoned.

It's not that hard.

They're also lucky the woman at the fast food place (or anyone else inside for that matter) didn't call the cops, particularly when they were blocking up the drive through lane.

If they want to potentially fuck up their lives that's fine. I don't really care, it's their life to fuck up. My problem comes when they endanger other peoples lives, which is what they're doing. 

If someone said they went out and had a few drinks, got a good buzz going then drove home people wouldn't say it isn't a big deal, that you're fine if you drive slowly or what ever excuses people like to trot out. It's a fucked up thing to do.

By their own rating system, they had more than a little buzz going. "

Doesn't make a difference if they kill someone or themselves.

Plenty of dangerous habits while driving that many people would rationalise as at least it isn't as bad as x. Like texting. Not as bad as alcohol, right? I mean you're only looking down for a few seconds and hell, you can glance at the road. Once you're driving slow you're fine. Not like you're vision is blurry, or you're judgement is impaired at all.

If they were at a 7, I see no difference in driving while drinking and this.

Basically you have open crib so your friends like to smoke at your place and their way of saying thanks is sparking you up. It's not like your expecting them to give you free drugs or anything when they come over and you do decline their offers of smoking but if they insist that you let them spark you up that's their fault. To me a mooch is someone who wants to chill and then tries to get a free session from you every single time you guys chill and he never offers to either sparks me up or match me.

So minimum out the door cost will be about $300 and up. Once your doctor submits it though, it can take a while to get your card. We also don't have a super long list of excuses like CA for getting your OMMP card so you'll have to check if either of those reasons are able to get you one. Come next year, the only reason to get a card will be if you want concentrates, edibles or strains with higher amounts of THC.

You can smoke anywhere in the city as long as you're reasonably discreet about it. Forbidden Drive is especially nice around 3-4PM when the sun is almost setting. It's also a killer place to smoke.

During those periods I'm sure work was heavier than usual or more stressful (why you stopped smoking in the first place.) It is probably more related to the fact that you are really having to get shit done in those moments. Your time to smoke is when you can be more layed back and have more flexibility. Kind of hard to argue with people when you don't have a ton of stress from work and have weed. Just my opinion tough; I'm a college student and when school gets though I stop smoking and the increase in stress is mostly all caused by long days and ""over stressing"" my brain and eyes."

3v3th1,cxk5c12,paperweightbaby,2015-12-02 00:50:34,"I don't have a prescription, but for the last year and a half I've been using it as a medicine (I don't smoke with other people anymore, I just smoke to deal with shit). That shit: 
   
     
1. Alcoholism- when I smoke, I don't like drinking alcohol. It tastes bad and gets too intense when I mix it with weed. So, if I'm having a hard time not going out and drinking, I vaporize some weed. I used to smoke it, but I'm trying to be healthier by cutting out the combustion. Anyway, it chills out my racing thoughts and cravings pretty well. I still drink, I'm a functional alcoholic, but compared to before it's very rare (a few drinks after work a couple of nights a week as opposed to every day). 
    
2. I used to take disulfiram, which makes you very sick if you drink any alcohol by affecting how your liver processes it. I requested it because alcohol was destroying my life. I took it for about a year and then went sober on my own without it, then fell off the wagon and started abusing alcohol and stimulants heavily when I went through some shit with a lady and didn't want to be alive anymore. 
     
3. I'm in university (going back was a part of my ""get sober"" plan), after I started smoking on a nightly basis my grades went up from C's to high Bs/As, and I put on 20 lbs (I was 5'11 and 125 when I was using stims and alcohol, now I'm at 148). I have a lot less anxiety than I used to because I don't go out and make an idiot out of myself and because I'm physically healthier and don't feel like my eyes are bulging out of my skull from being up for days on stimulants. I've spent a lot more time getting to know myself and how I feel and what I believe in, which alcohol and speed take away from you. I actually care about what I'm doing in school, instead of just wanting to half-ass my way to a degree. 
     
4. I've thought about it. I'm struggling, even with the weed. I don't want to start smoking in the day time, because I get really tired, and I get anxious if I have stuff to do when I'm high- but I'm craving alcohol and have started drinking in the afternoon (this wasn't an issue before). It's probably just exam time getting to me. I'm still in denial about my drinking problem, and disulfiram would make sure that doesn't negatively impact me any more than it already has. For now though, the weed is effective in helping me manage/reduce the problem drinking. I have a psychiatrist's appointment in three weeks, I might talk to her about it. I have not told her about smoking weed, I don't want her to tell me to stop smoking because it works for me and doctors often stigmatize weed (she doesn't know how bad things were before I started smoking). 
      
5. Before my friend reintroduced me to weed at his house the summer before last, I pictured weed as a medicine for people with stuff like cancer, HIV, serious pain, and stuff like that. I originally went over to get shitfaced but ended up smoking and only having half a drink. It felt like a weight was lifted because I didn't just want to stop drinking after the half drink, I actually *could* stop drinking after the half drink. And after watching the sunset and sobering up I went and visited my parents, which I normally wouldn't/couldn't do because I didn't want them to see what I was turning into, with the drinking and hard drug use. I never really thought that treating substance abuse with weed would be a good idea, because I figured that if you replace a substance with another substance you aren't any better off. But the fact is, I can vaporize every night before bed (and I go to bed early to keep from going out) and wake up fine, function like a human being, not need to constantly drink gatoraide and pop aspirin and spend shitloads of money on liquor and terrible, greasy food that my body could barely process so that my body kept operating and feeling like hell. 
     
     
It hasn't given my life back, I still struggle every day with depression and anxiety, but it gives me a foothold into the world that pharmaceuticals never could. And, it introduced me to the Trees Network, which has gotten me through some hard nights. "

I smoke everyday when I wake up. I convince myself this is alright because I ""feel better"". To clarify, a year after a near death experience I have a pessimistic perspective concerning life. Bud gives me a happier outlook, I dream, but I never attempt my dreams. These dreams while sober make me sad that I'm not there, as I feel that I have screwed up my life. Then I smoke again and the process continues. It has been an escape into an alternative reality. It has been addictive and detrimental.

I have now realized how much it has messed with my studies, and I truly want to stop. At least take an extended break again. I have proven myself to be irresponsible and unable to find a happy medium between smoking and school. I have a ~bowl left, and I plan to rid myself of it tonight. Wish me luck, because I'm trying to crack down.

Your body was so used to getting high everyday probably on some type of routine and was accustomed to getting THC at certain times and now that that isn't happening your body is trying to get used to normal sober life and not receiving that THC. If your mood and whatever is really bad then I'd suggest if possible trying to taper off it. By this I mean for the 1st 2 weeks limit yourself to smoking 2 times a week. Then the next 2 weeks limit once a week. If you feel you need more weed for the 2 weeks change the times you allow yourself to smoke to fit your needs. Just make sure every 2 weeks you cut it down.

In your case, I'd recommend getting only slightly high in the morning and then doing something. Getting at a 1 or 2 will help with the symptoms but you can still go out. Then only smoke when your day is over. So like when you're done with classes and homework or your done working for the day. Personally you should wait till an hour or two before bedtime to smoke.

3v3lvf,cxk2cgl,LittleMeow_,2015-12-01 22:57:11,"Speaking from personal experience...
I have been on several different SSRI's and SNRI's the past few years, as well as seeing multiple therapists. Antidepressants always numbed all of my feelings. I wasn't sad or depressed any more, but I wasn't happy either. I really didn't give a shit about anything, I didn't have feelings towards anyone or anything. It's not a nice feeling at all. I also found they give you a lot of negative physical effects, convulsions, nausea, insomnia, etc.
I started smoking a year ago. NOTHING has ever made me feel better than marijuana. It's not even about getting high for me a lot of the time now, I can smoke once and I'll feel better for a week or two. It makes me feel so at peace with myself and everything around me. I feel so much more happy, positive, confident. I'm more of the person I want to be.

But nobody can decide for you what is better, or what is going to work. You have to figure that out yourself. You won't know how SSRI's work for you unless you try."

3v3iqz,cxk17ip,CoastalTW,2015-12-01 22:21:32,"They are definitely for enjoyment and yes most green outs come from edibles. Major reason for that is that edibles are absorbed differently than through smoke. It only takes 15 seconds for inhaled cannabis to start affecting your system. Edibles take up to an hour+ and most people are too impatient and eat too many. Another cause of green out by edible is that edibles give you the indica body high feeling. Lots of people smoke sativas and are used to a completely different type of high.  But edibles are most commonly used by people that can't smoke their medicine. They have arthritis, cancer, MS, etc. They require strong pain relief that is easy on their system. The big thing is to remember that these are medicinal products and are made to be very potent. "

What's your experience with doses? How high does a single 10mg does get you? Considering a single drink (whether 1 beer or a 1.5 0z shot) barely produces a change in mental state even on an empty stomach, I'm assuming a single dose of marijuana would be the equivalent of like a 6 pack of beer given the testimonies of people who have taken multiple doses."

Honestly, it really ranges, I'm a daily high dose user, so my tolerance really fluctuate. When I (125lb) started using medical edibles 5mg took my pain away with mild, to no, psychoactive. Around that time frame of a low tolerance, I decided to take 10mg sublingually (suckalbe candy)- it hit me hard, I even had a short open eyed hallucination of a holographic horse head, great trip though! Now days, 10 mgs is nothing, I'm currently at a medical dosage of ~200mg, down recently from over 1,000mg. Understanding exactly how much to dose out is difficult if you don't keep up with your tolerance by regularly testing/using with accurately labelled edibles."

To gain more empathy just do what you do sober. Try to genuinely understand a person's needs, wants and views instead of assuming you know them. Instead of saying ""I know you want this because..."" Ask ""So what do you want from this situation, what makes you say that, how did you feel after that,  ect"" **SEEK FIRST TO UNDERSTAND THEN TO BE UNDERSTOOD.**

 **Listen** what people say, many people think they're listening but they're not. They're hear  noise for five seconds then thinking about what they have to say. To practice listening play a minute or less audio clip. Afterwords repeat back the same exact thing they said. No summaries or guess, word for fucking word.

So when watching TV, listening to music, or talking to someone. Listen to what they said, ask them how it made them feel and why, put yourself in that situation, the responsed. TA DA empathy!"

It's similar to when someone with asthma uses an inhaler, they're instructed to breathe in as deeply as they can so the medication can get all the way down.

Isn't a brain tumor something your doctor would have on record? Just get a record of your medical history, go to the doctor that of your choice and explain to him that you'd like to try medical.

- Tell your mom to fuck off, youre 18 and can handle yourself.

- set up a doctors appointment by your self, and go by yourself.

Also, lets be honest. If you can't get the mmj card without worrying about your mother. How the living hell are you going to keep

- /u/Nugroll, lets use cancer as an example. Do you think we have a cure? I think we have had a cure possibly for decades but will not and never will release it to the public simply due to the amount of revenue that it created. If cancer was cured overnight, billions would be lost. Millions, such as oncologists. pharmacies, chemotherapy centers, etc. would be out of a job. If marijuana is cultivated to potentially treat/cure a broad spectrum of illnesses/diseases/etc, it would be much less profitable than marijuana could be genetically modified to perform one task only, like prescription drugs. The more strains that need to be produced for one specific illness = more strains need to be produced for other specific illnesses = ultimately creating a larger demand for more marijuana and creating more jobs and revenue. 

- /u/MidnightToker3 If the federal government produces marijuana so abundantly and could create a delivery service that makes it cheaper and more accessible to all who need it, do you think they would go with the (hypothetical) internet website where you can legally order marijuana with the simplicity of ordering pizza and having it delivered to your doorstep in 20 minutes, or calling your dealer who may or may not have the strain that you want, and who may or may not be able to deliver within the next hour because he has other stops to make.

Step 3: Find a doctor that is canna friendly. 

Think of it like this - your car needs maintenance to run properly.  Every time you go in to have it looked at the mechanic does everything splendidly, but they fart in the drivers seat when they drive it out for you to go home. You either put up with a situation that kind of stinks every time you go there, or find someone that does the job without shitting on you. 

There are resources online to find canna friendly docs. Also (at least in most parts of the US where it hasn't legalized) if you tell the doc that you imbibe cannabis in any fashion you are put on a list that restricts access to other medications like pain killers, mood elevators, etc. because you're a big bad no good druggie doper pile of excrement.

3v33f7,cxjz4u1,nugroll,2015-12-01 21:22:23,Googling it would be easier. But put some in a small bottle and make sure the piss is at body temperature. Also try and have some background noise so they don't hear the bottle when it squirts out.

3v2xpo,cxk3bnp,A_Challenger_Emerges,2015-12-01 23:30:39,"Don't take my word as law, but after having a severe concussion/head trauma I had a few specialists/doctors talk to me about avoiding substances for a while so you body can do its magic. If I remember correctly it was 2/3 months for the brain to get to a relatively healed point. Then 12 months for a ""full"" healing.

 You don't want to take substances, especially during the beginning, because your body knows how to take care of itself. If you flood your body with chemicals after a traumatic experience there is no guarantee that your body will still know how to take care of itself in a wounded state.

Probably depends on severity of the trauma though."

3v2ljb,cxjs7gp,SoonKeem,2015-12-01 18:19:41,"Welcome!!! Some rules just off the top of my head would be something like:

- Always dry your lips before hitting a joint or a blunt. No one likes when you ""nigga lip"" the j.

- Never blow into a bong. Draw in air slowly and accumulate the smoke on top of the water, then clear the chamber in one go.

- Most of the friends I smoke with are uncomfortable with reeking. So whenever you blow out try to blow upwards to minimize the amount of smoke exposure to your clothes and hair.

- I feel as if sesh rules always change depending on who you smoke with. I always try to clear up what direction the bong/joint/blunt is going around and how many hits to take before starting to smoke.

- I hate when people pour my eyedrops into their eyes because they suck at aiming. Tilt your head back, man the fuck up and stop blinking so much, and look straight into the hole of the drops and squeeze. 1-2 drops in each eye is fine, 2-3 if you're extra sketched out.

All I got for now, hope it helps!"
