3n4nwk,cvks1sz,surprisingly_wise,2015-10-01 13:31:46,PM me. I work in the industry.
3n4nwk,cvkterd,WatershedJamieL,2015-10-01 14:04:41,I sent you a PM
3n4nwk,cvkx35a,roburn,2015-10-01 15:30:27,"Ditto to Hazelden. Beautiful location, good with insurance, lots of different programs for ages groups, etc. Plus then you'll be near the Twin Cities which is a sober mecca. I moved to MN 4 years ago for sober living and haven't left since!   "
3n2u24,cvkf26x,Nostalgia_Drive,2015-10-01 07:49:17,"You aren't drunk yet.

That's big. That matters. I'm in a perpetual state of moving towards a drink myself and that's great. When I feel as though I have no other goals to strive for, I can at least keep up work on maintaining my sobriety. It gets difficult to continue sometimes and sometimes the future looks bleaker but I've felt what you feel countless times and I made it through. The most basic tenants I can pass along from AA that help me when I don't want to drink is to ask for help and help someone else and it sounds like you're on the right track because you aren't drunk today."
3n2u24,cvkay9b,blacksnakewhip,2015-10-01 03:16:40,"It would be helpful to know how long you have been sober thus far, and what have you been doing to stay sober?"
3n2u24,cvkb1gl,savethefairyland,2015-10-01 03:22:53,"Ah, sorry: since October 18 2013, mostly sheer willpower (helped along by AA mantras), DBT and talking with a therapist and a psychiatrist at regular intervals. I also have some close friends do I chat with about it, but I try not to worry them too much :/ "
3n2u24,cvkbi4m,blacksnakewhip,2015-10-01 03:57:52,"It sounds familiar to me. I was sober for 12 years on a combination of willpower, marriage and church, but I found out the hard way that abstinence alone isn't a treatment for real alcoholism. I've been happily and gratefully sober in AA for 7 years this time. I'm assuming that the DBT, therapist, and psychiatrist indicate co-occurring disorders. Have you talked to them about this? Sometimes we self-medicate with alcohol and other substances. After all, we don't really view alcohol as a problem; we view it as a solution. Have you considered a determined attention at AA on the level of being sponsored through step work and getting involved in a sober fellowship? Are the friends you mentioned in AA? Also, if you're still involved with the active ex, you might benefit from a good Al-anon group. Just something to consider. "

3n2u24,cvkmfgl,jimburrwell,2015-10-01 11:17:17,"I can tell you I completely identify with feeling this way. It totally sucks. For anyone, going through what you are would be exceptionally difficult. You are under a tremendous amount of stress, uncertainty about the future, and sadness. You are not weak, you are human. Things really do suck, no doubt about it. Now what?  

The only thing I can tell you is this is temporary. You have to dig deep. You have to remind yourself that you will feel awesome if you drink...then you really won't. Then you will feel waaaaaaaaay worse. Nothing will ultimately get better, and you will be right back where you are now if you are lucky, but you will probably feel worse and be dealing with even more shit. You already know this, just keep saying it to yourself over and over and over again. 

I don't believe in God, but if you do, pray. Surround yourself by people in recovery. Don't take chances by putting yourself in a position where you are vulnerable to slipping. ( This can be a subconscious form of self-sabatage. )  Take care of yourself! Eat well. Sleep well. Exercise even a little. Go to movies by yourself or with friends as a form of distraction. Talk to your therapist about medication if you are suffering from serious anxiety or depression. Stay as busy as possible when you are not resting or taking care of yourself in other ways. 

Keep acting ""as if"" until things get better. They will. One day at a time they will if you just keep putting one foot in front of the other.

I am jobless as well, and dealing with a similar amount of shit. Thank you for sharing. It was good saying to you what I needed to remind myself of. "
3n2u24,cvkb8sg,Carmac,2015-10-01 03:37:47,"Haven't really had that problem since my first month or so sober, but have often talked with many who have. What seemed to help with most is getting more heavily involved with AAers and 'tricks', like downing a chocolate malt or piece of cake, going over their check book for the last few months of their drinking, calling and/or having a coffee with sponsors, etc. 
"
3n2u24,cvkda9v,wtfudgery,2015-10-01 06:08:26,"Honestly, what gets me through each day is knowing that using is not an option.  I cannot and will not use under any circumstances.  Easier said than done, I know, but using is not an option. "
3n2u24,cvkghfh,TomStrasbourg,2015-10-01 08:39:44,"Not OP, but I hate this notion that ""I can't use."" or ""using is not an option"". Barring a physical inability to get the drink or drug into my system, it is always an option. It's a terrible option, but I can't say that it isn't an option. I chose it all the time for years, even when I knew it was a problem. By acknowledging it as an option that I'm not taking because I don't want to face the consequences of it anymore, I recognize the new paradigm I live by: Staying sober at all costs and not staying loaded at all costs. "
3n2u24,cvkjvip,wtfudgery,2015-10-01 10:15:12,I see what you're saying :) For me - it's not an option.  I will die. 
3n2u24,cvkjyzk,throwawayeveryday7,2015-10-01 10:17:43,"You are still sober so don't discount that. I think given what you are going through, it's very normal to want to use; we use to ameliorate pain and suffering, and you are going through a painful time. Please don't get down on yourself for *wanting* to use. But remember that using is a shit coping mechanism for your problems. It only causes more problems and also worsens the problems that are already there. Remember, pain passes, as long as you move through it. If you use, you will fail to move through it, so it will stick around and lurk forever beneath the surface and resurface repeatedly.  Move through it and allow it to pass, no matter how long it takes. When we get sober, we agree to accept the happiness in life along with the pain. If you want the joy of life, you gotta take the crap too. You don't get to pick and choose; that's not how life works. Accept this pain and allow for it to pass, even if it takes a long time. You will feel happiness again; you just gotta move through this. That's the deal we make when we agree to do life."
3n2u24,cvkq4wg,awareness1111,2015-10-01 12:45:20,"Your idea of getting shitfaced all the time (yet again) is you, avoiding the pain of dealing with the things you haven't yet dealt with, either internally (heart, soul, head) or externally (job, family, law, etc).

If I may be blunt, stop f*cking around, and deal with what you have to deal with.  You have a child that needs you, and a life to live.

The adjustment period from being a soaking-wet drunk to living a cleaner, healthier life is not easy.  It is a daily operation, and one that requires focus, commitment and support.

However, no one is coming to save you.  You must save yourself.  

Instead of avoiding the pain, be in it.  Sit, cry, throw things, write a journal, call a close friend - do whatever you have to do to accept both your pain, and your situation...

and then carry the f*ck on.

Good luck, man.  Stay strong."
3n2u24,cvkiq9u,hardman52,2015-10-01 09:45:01,Call AA.
3n13tk,cvjxjg9,ginger_sprout,2015-09-30 18:56:30,"I actually can think of two people with eating disorders who've gone to open meetings I was at. It wasn't an issue with either of them, though, of course, meetings do vary. As far as I recall, both people talked about their ED in general terms - talking about addiction and using and the steps, etc, in a way that was in keeping with the rest of the meeting."
3n13tk,cvjxx2e,girlownsworld,2015-09-30 19:07:17,Thanks! It's good to know that you've seen ED people there in the past. 
3n13tk,cvkl0vu,Compline,2015-10-01 10:42:46,Anyone at all is welcome to attend an open meeting for any reason.
3n13tk,cvjwpgc,Elliotrosemary,2015-09-30 18:32:54,Yes it depends on the meeting but aa meetings are a little bit different then oa. You can sit in the back and not participate at all if that is what you are interested in. Most people are pretty accepting of members of other 12 step groups being there. 
3n13tk,cvjxyp7,girlownsworld,2015-09-30 19:08:32,"Oh great! Aha. OA meetings I've been to are usually round circle, and super small."
3n13tk,cvjy8rx,Elliotrosemary,2015-09-30 19:16:22,"Yea some of the oa meetings I attended had everybody gi around the room and qualify themselves as an over eater- I think I've only seen that at closed aa meetings but at open meetings they don't. The aa groups are usually much larger and you can always say ""pass"" if for some reason somebody calls on you. If youre comfortable saying your visiting from oa then that is fine too, just do whatever makes you feel comfortable :)"
3n13tk,cvk3701,girlownsworld,2015-09-30 21:38:04,Thanks for the suggestion! 
3n13tk,cvk6jxo,disastermode,2015-09-30 23:27:53,"I go to two meetings of AA where we go around and introduce ourselves, mostly as alcoholics. Some people say their name and that they're visitors at those"
3n13tk,cvk23m1,Rks1157,2015-09-30 21:05:57,"In my area you're more than welcome to sit and listen in any open meeting.  You wouldn't be able to participate in discussion unless you identity as an alcoholic in many but not all of our groups so if you need to talk you'd have to grab someone before or after the meeting.

"
3n13tk,cvkcjm9,teenyandthebee,2015-10-01 05:18:10,I do this all the time. I just identify as an addict. 
3n13tk,cvkt3wm,gfpumpkins,2015-10-01 13:57:31,I am a member of Al-Anon and have regularly attended AA meetings over the 12+ years I've been in the program. I respect their traditions by not speaking at meetings and making sure any new comers who talk to me before or after understand that I'm in a different program. I've never had a problem. 
3n13tk,cvjwnh3,sikkkunt,2015-09-30 18:31:23,"heroin addict that goes to aa here.

i stick with the people who got high to identify, but the solution at 12 steps meetings is the same. i'm sure you could find some OA people at AA meeting, ask around. open meetings can't do shit, closed ones can."
3n13tk,cvjxzzj,girlownsworld,2015-09-30 19:09:34,What's the difference between open and closed meetings in your opinion?
3n13tk,cvk2bf9,Rks1157,2015-09-30 21:12:09,"Closed meetings are limited to those who have a desire to stop drinking so no family, friends or children (unless they are alcoholics). We don't sign court papers at closed meetings.    I secretary two of our weekly closed meetings and make it a point to introduce myself to anyone I've never seen before and let them know about the court paper thing in case that's what they're there for.   If so, I give them directions to the other  group in town.    Between the two groups we've scheduled our meetings so there's always an open meeting going on.   "
3n13tk,cvjy5hn,k_mouse2,2015-09-30 19:13:51,"closed meetings are for alcoholics or those who think they might have a problem with alcohol only. open meetings anyone at all can go to.

i wouldn't even be too concerned about the language about alcohol in the open/closed difference. i have a friend who was addicted to heroin and meth and she is now a happy member of AA with 5 years sober. she secretaries AA meetings, and of course attends closed meetings, even though she technically didn't have a problem with *alcohol*"
3n13tk,cvk3d4q,daaaaanadolores,2015-09-30 21:43:15,"Same with my dad. When he was alive and trying to get off heroin and crack, he went to AA (for some reason, the area in and around my hometown was teeming with AA meetings with very few, if any, NA meetings) and met many others whose substance of choice wasn't alcohol."
