3n5069,cvkwk23,KetoJam,2015-10-01 15:18:05,"OMG, I used to be exhausted from every trip I took.  It was so nice this year to go on a real vacation, and relax.

Welcome back!  "
3n4wtn,cvktflt,in4real,2015-10-01 14:05:14,">  I am a piece of shit.

No you are not.  You were right the first time.

As a chronic relapser I can only tell you what helped me.  Antabuse.  Now I am far longer sober now than I have every been out of treatment before.

Also, I truly had enough.  Are you ready to stop?  I believe I was finally 46 days ago.  It keeps me taking the Antabuse.  "
3n4wtn,cvkunnl,feverfor-theflavor,2015-10-01 14:33:08,"I really appreciate your response but I tried Antabuse and still drank on it. I remember the short breath feeling and the red face, it was terrible but not deterring. 

I appreciate that you think I am a nice person but in reality I am not, I am selfish. I hate my life and drink because I dont want to think about it."
3n4wtn,cvkwqal,in4real,2015-10-01 15:22:07,"I don't know you and even if I did I can't convince you of anything.

However, whenever an alcoholic tells me they are selfish I think ""no kidding"".

Hang in there."
3n4wtn,cvkw0gb,PredictedHissler,2015-10-01 15:05:02,">I am a piece of shit  

Nope.  I'm becoming well aware that that kind of shame is exactly what I tried to blot out with alcohol and exactly what makes me miserable now that I'm not drinking.  Being good to yourself - physically, emotionally - is part of the road to really recovering.  I realize now that I was incredibly selfish when I was drinking, but I also realize now that people really are capable of changing."

3n4up3,cvktkt7,KetoJam,2015-10-01 14:08:41,"Welcome!

I had some pretty terrible experiences in blackouts as well. I also vacillated between daily drinking and binge drinking, to prove I wasn't a problem drinker.  Things got a LOT easier for me when I just quit drinking altogether.

I was able to hang on by sheer willpower alone for at most 6 weeks, back when I was 30 (I am now 36).  This time, I have over a year under my belt, and I used a lot of tools: Therapy (both couples and individual - there's some infidelity I am also not proud of), I SD like crazy here on reddit, and I also attend recovery support group meetings.

Hang in there - things can get really awesome if you put in some work.  :)"
3n4up3,cvku8ty,CarWashRhino,2015-10-01 14:23:50,"It's nice to hear I'm not the only one.  I'll have to look into both therapy and support groups.  What exactly do you mean when you say you SD?

3n4m8b,cvkr9ha,perfik09,2015-10-01 13:13:01,"I stopped cold turkey. Been 25 years. It's possible although I am not sure recommended. Was it hard, hell yes. Was it worth it, you can probably guess my answer to that. 

I'm a stubborn egomaniac though."
3n4m8b,cvkqj3a,OttabMike,2015-10-01 12:54:54,"People quit on their own all the time - without access to either Detox or Rehab. In my experience (AA for 19 Years) most people benefit from the support that is available for free at any AA or NA meeting. You would meet people who get it, they've been where you are and they've found a way to get sober. It can't hurt. If AA doesn't appeal to you for any reason then see if there is some other support group in your area that could help. Quitting on your own, all alone, is damned hard. Having someone to share with - as you vent, as your body goes through withdrawal, is critical to your ability to stay sober.

Good luck."
3n4m8b,cvkr3uc,One_Cold_Turkey,2015-10-01 13:09:14,"I decided to kill myself of boredom... I didn't drink and I didn't sleep, for 2-3 weeks. Then it got better.  The alternative was drinking, but what good did it do? I drank btw as most of us, for years, every day, religiously. 

Now it is not really fun -drinking was not that much fun either, but I slept. I can only confirm that sleeping without booze is possible, just give your body a chance to adjust.

I am still very early on my recovery. I do not say I will not relapse in the future. I just can say I will not relapse today.

Additionally, I was on pills (not Valium), also for years. I quit both the same day.

Good luck."

there's lots of others who just stop drinking on their own and they don't think anything of it."
3n4m8b,cvktvr8,KetoJam,2015-10-01 14:15:52,I didn't take drugs to detox.  I lived.  
3n4m8b,cvktvv7,gogomom,2015-10-01 14:15:56,"I personally needed the 45 days of rehab to stop, then I needed / need AA and NA to help me stay stopped."
3n4m8b,cvkuc8t,Sly_Wood,2015-10-01 14:25:51,"No. Not me at least.

I think most people here know that alcohol (benzos as well) is the only substance that can kill you if you quit cold turkey. Well, that was the case for me. I was so deeply ingrained into drinking everyday that I could not stop, no matter how much willpower I had. I just couldn't. I wasn't a bad drunk and I didn't do anything I regret. It was my body simply giving out. So even when I was terrified of dying in my sleep, through a seizure or whatever, and my heart raced, I still refused to ask for help. I lasted all throughout the night, restlessly battling the impossiblly relentless waves of anxiety, until I realized I really couldn't keep it going an longer.

I have the willpower to stay sober. Aboslutely. But jesus, if I touch a bottle then that fish hook will lodge itself and I'm pretty sure I won't be able to beat it again."
3n4m8b,cvkv5f0,ecky--ptang-zooboing,2015-10-01 14:44:28,"Thanks for your story.

I went into rehab and I must admit it was relatively easy, probably because of the medication I got, which made me sleep all the time. But I can't go back, the waiting line is too long. And I have work to do. I have a supply of Valium and that's basically what they did, give me valium because my blood pressure was 180+ when I stopped drinking. I am now moving with  family for 3 months to try this and will take small doses of Valium throughout the day. I feel like such a failure. And I am a failure, until I get through this. Alcohol should be illegal, it's ruining my life for over 10 years because it's available on every street corner. And I'm not talking about 1-2 glasses of wine or a beer... they;re amounts that most people would get into the hospital. I've made many whiney posts here, and good some good tips, but now it's getting out of hand and I don't know how to get out of this vicious circle... fuck alcohol, I'd rather be on coke or xtc than on alcohol.... it ruins your body and social life."
3n4m8b,cvkvaqm,Sly_Wood,2015-10-01 14:47:55,"I successfully detoxed off of Benzos I was prescribed. It took me somewhere from 2-4 weeks to completely ween off the benzos. I made it a point to not finish the bottle and I still haven't. I'm pretty proud of that. But yea, what the doctor prescribes you is there to help you. There's no shame in that. Just learn not to rely on it and do your best. If I can do it, so can you."

3n4i8j,cvkq1q7,evanarchy,2015-10-01 12:43:11,"what you describe is exactly what my problem is. I consider it alcoholism, but that's a label you don't HAVE to own ,as long as you wish to stop and get healthy again.  time heals most of the issues with not drinking including being at bars and around alcohol. I went to a wedding a few weeks ago and always had a glass of soda water with lime in my hands... I drank so many of those, I would have been WASTED if it were alcohol (lol) but having the non-alcoholic drink in my hands kept me comfortable and not exposed and also didn't welcome questions from others as to why I'm not drinking.  Good luck and it's totally worth it! "
3n4i8j,cvkttx6,KetoJam,2015-10-01 14:14:39,"I drank a lot like you.

I put on WELL over 20 pounds - try 20 times 5.  It still didn't stop me from doing it.

I never lost a job, never crashed a car, and even though I did horrible things to my partner, he never left. I STILL got to a point where I decided to quit.  Why?  Because I hated my life.  I was miserable. I was nowhere near to living up to my potential.

I used to have dinner parties every weekend, with wine and beer and vodka pairings.  Things are different now, but I still entertain.  There are awesome NA cocktail recipes out there, and to be honest, I am better at entertaining when I am not in a brown out.  

I hope you stick around with us.  I can't promise you the same future I had, but I can tell you that my experience was that things got steadily worse in my twenties and then QUICKLY way worse in my thirties.  My only regret about quitting drinking was that I didn't do it sooner.  "

3n46s9,cvkro63,Ihearcolor,2015-10-01 13:22:46,"For me, it felt bad to relapse because I'd throw away any progress I made during my sober time. I needed to heal emotionally, and getting drunk again would just re-open the wound and bring me right back to what I was trying to escape. Time is important because it allows the mind/body to recover and start to operate ""normally"" again. I've heard that it can take anywhere from 1-3 years of sobriety before the brain starts to fire normally again (like that of a non-drinker). Though food/sugar addiction is a very real thing the effects aren't as debilitating in larger quantities. Who knows though, for some people it may be, but for us the kyptonite is alcohol so falling into other ""smaller"" vices doesn't have the same effect. Congrats on your month! Here's to another one ;)"
3n46s9,cvkn4mm,coolcrosby,2015-10-01 11:32:23,"Here's the answer as I experienced it.  While the occasional cookie binge is not so great if you're obese or a diabetic, cookies are not immediately toxic to my brain and body.  Furthermore I've never encountered a case where someone drove their car headlong into a school bus impaired on cookies.  EVERY day at local news websites you can read about drunk driving or violent tragedies involving drunks.  Finally, recovery from alcoholism, sustained time sober allows the body and brain to recover from (in my case) daily overdosing with ETOH, and as a result I am healthier, I have more clarity, and I finally reached a point where I was able to address the causes and conditions of my alcoholism and in turn help others.

3n46s9,cvkpupg,PredictedHissler,2015-10-01 12:38:25,">If I were to swear off cookies then one day slip up and eat a bunch I wouldn't feel too bad.  

I've thought about this too.  To give in to temptation is human.  The problem as I see it is that, 1) for many drinkers, it's often not a one day slip up, but a return to active drinking.  I had a year without drinking in 2008.  The 90 days I have today is the longest I've gone without drinking since I went back out.  The best way to avoid this happening again is to avoid drinking altogether.  2) Drinking has had some serious negative consequences for me.  Again, the only surefire way to avoid these and worse consequences from drinking is to just not start drinking again.

But EVERY single person in there that speaks, has a story that I can relate to, at least a little bit.

And that helps me tremendously. During the meetings I want a beer so bad, but after I just don't. It's like a huge weight lifted off my shoulders. Sometimes I go to 2 meetings a day.

Some of those people have hit a really terrible bottom. Like prison, losing everything they own, losing their spouse, their kids, their self respect. Mainly because of drinking.

I can't relate to those people's stories exactly. But I can imagine getting there given a few more years.

But they are all very happy now. And they have a great support group to fall back on when things get tough. It's an amazing thing to witness, if you think about it.

I don't speak, I just listen. And I learn a lot every single day.

I've been a daily drinker without missing a single day for 13 years. And AA plus some major self restraint has given me my life back, even if just for a week so far."

Best thing I ever did - just approximate how much per day you spent on  booze and smokes and multiply that by how many days you're sober and smoke free. The number will likely be a lot higher than you think. At 17 days, a modest guess is I've saved $400.... bur probably closer to $450-$500."

Then I saw my roommate quickly knocking back a couple before heading to a bus. I actually got wistful for the ability to drink and it pissed me off.

And lets talk ""cravings.""  If you have been alcohol free for 10 months you are not having physical cravings.  What you are experiencing, maybe, is the mental ""obsession"" with alcohol that so many of us describe as part of our disease.  This mental obsession, IMO, cannot be willed away.  It generally requires proactive work in recovery to make fundamental changes in our psyche.  It is hard work but possible and, when done, can make all the difference in the world to someone's sobriety.

Going back to drinking does not fix this obsession.  It only feeds it and makes it stronger.

My advice would be to keep your life full so you don't even have time to drink. Make a plan, cook dinner every night, start a book, go to the gym everyday, if a friend asks for help then agree to help (as long as you KNOW alcohol won't be involved).

Relying on just willpower can be exhausting, and for me it is a finite resource.  New habits rely less on brain power, and more on just showing up once they're put in place.

  That's how I set myself up for success, creating new habits instead of hoping for the best and relying on myself to always be in a good mental headspace that feels strong enough to use willpower keep up the fight.  "

But what had really happened was that I'd turned from a heavy daily drinker into a binge drinker.  I wasn't ""moderating,"" I was doing the same behavior and alternating it with periods of total abstinence.  And gradually, the periods of abstinence got shorter and the binges got longer.  

After a traumatic life event, I had a ""binge"" that lasted over a month and looked an awful lot like my prior drinking habits.  After a year of the moderation experiment, I was withdrawing from alcohol addiction again.  And even with all I had ""learned,"" *addiction had not changed.*  My body and mind were still sick.  I still had great difficulty passing the three day mark.

I consider it a lesson learned.  Sober ever since."

Average people who drink can naturally moderate without thinking about it, and they have 1 maybe 2 drinks on occasion. That's moderation to me.

You already hit it: ""Life is just way more fulfilling in every way without it!""

Saving money to spend on hobbies that make me feel good rather than empty, saving calories to shed weight to boost confidence, or to eat ice cream on a Saturday night while watching Netflix. Most of all, for me at least, I went from having days where I feel normal and days where I feel crappy, to having days where I feel normal and days where I feel *great*.

I ask them if they think their life would be better, in any aspect, if drinking were out of the equation, and the answer is usually yes for us alcoholics. My life sober is more enjoyable and healthy than my life when I was not sober. It's something I can look at as a concrete fact, and to me it just makes sense."

3n2n1u,cvkru38,SohoCat,2015-10-01 13:26:39,"Well said!

Moderation has shown me that not all of my thoughts and perceptions can be trusted, at least not right away. I don't have to follow every stupid impulse. If I wait an hour ... even five minutes in some cases ... the urge to drink passes. It either passes or I go to bed and fall asleep. Sitting with my thoughts when I want a drink has become a kind of meditation for me. It's not fun, but very enlightening. And at the end of the day, as the good ole saying goes, I've never regretted not drinking."

So good for you for realizing the problems alcohol is causing you because trust me, it only gets worse from here if you continue to drink and ignore said problems.  It is never too early to call it quits and throw in the towel.  The benefits of drinking are minuscule, maybe even non-existent compared to the harm and risks that it can bring.

It's a bit of a double edged sword.  I need to check in here less and go to some real world meetings or volunteer somewhere,  or maybe I don't - this could be why I'm feeling good at the moment.  I am keeping the focus very definitely on my sobriety, even if it consumes me a bit too much at times. 

I dunno, but I think I understand how you feel about the being 'wrapped up'.  Keep fighting the good fight! "

I find that in addition to trying to talk to other people about their lives or help another person, re-honing in on my meditation practice has been really beneficial.

Last night I sat there for 10-12 minutes and just had waves and waves of **painful** anxiety wash over me. I find that if I take some time each day to feel some feelings, everything is much better though. Hope you move out of this rough patch soon."

3n22nz,cvk4w99,joeblough,2015-09-30 22:30:24,"> maybe this time I will not give in...

I don't read a lot of commitment and conviction there...

My sobriety hasn't happened by passively sitting by and hoping, ""Maybe I'll make it another day..."" It's ACTIVE! I have to engage **every day**, I have to be vigilant **every day**, I have to choose not to drink **every day**.

But that's just me.

"
3n22nz,cvk4xzf,Chuggalugg,2015-09-30 22:31:58,Keep up with those positive thoughts.  I didn't drink today and may i join you in not giving in?!  I was a basket case earlier today and am feeling much better now.  Its like a roller coaster isn't it.  But ya know what?  We don't have to go on that ride again.  Hang in there
3n22nz,cvk50gq,Chuggalugg,2015-09-30 22:34:09,Oh and congrats on your 1 week of sobriety!
3n22nz,cvk5up6,sunjim,2015-09-30 23:02:16,">Isn't it odd how one day can be so dissimilar from the next, 

This is a really, really good point. To my way of thinking, having a plan for not drinking mitigates whatever circumstances turn up in a day. If I have a plan--if I know exactly what I will do if I encounter and urge or a risk, *before* I am in the thick of it--then I don't have uncertainty. I already know what I will do, whatever happens.

Make sense? Making a plan for not drinking removes the dissimilarity. It makes one day more like another, because no matter what, your plan returns you to the baseline of not drinking. 

In my experience it takes more than determination and will power. I tried that a lot over 35 years, and except for one period of not drinking, it always failed. Will power is not enough, because it takes just one weak moment. Plans overcome weak moments; they don't require making good decisions when it's hardest to do so. They help you scratch the uncertainty of ""maybe."""

I am spending more time alone, but really thinking about what I want to do with my future. I have a career right now, but am thinking about going back to school in order to do something in the sciences. Not drinking gives me a little more clarity to do that. Plus, I'm trying to do more sober social activities, like joining a jogging group. It's a really good feeling to be back to a sober lifestyle. "

I would, personally, high advise seeking emergency medical treatment."

It's possible the one you went to just didn't have any beds available. 

As for the hallucinations, it could be either your disorder acting up or alcohol withdrawal. A lot of people itt are only mentioning withdrawal, but I have BP and definitely hallucinate when I'm off my meds and in a rough patch, which it sounds like this is. In addition to not drinking, a good mood stabilizer will do you a world of good. I owe my life to lithium, honestly. "

Realistically, if they've already rescinded the offer you probably don't have a great shot at changing their mind, but you do have a chance. I would be sure to point out that you never tried to hide it or cover it up in any way. *I've made mistakes, I own those mistakes, and I've learned from those mistakes. I'm an honest person and I've been nothing but honest throughout this entire process.*  

To me, honesty is the most important thing.  If it came down to two candidates, one an honest star and one a dishonest superstar I'd pick the honest guy every time.  

If dishonesty isn't a factor here then they're probably concerned about having to get rid of you should you go astray. Maybe they'd be open to taking you on for a limited time on a provisional basis.  From their point of view it would eliminate a lot of the risk.

The alcohol helped me to numb those feelings, but it also made my depression so much worse. Once I stopped drinking my depression got better, and as I started to improve it got easier to feel better over time. I still have negative feelings every once in a while, but I have learned that I am worthy of kindness and am better at treating myself like I would want others to treat me.

I didn't feel better for about five or six months. I was white knuckling it for sure. Going to AA helped me to feel like part of a bigger community, but it took me a while to find a meeting I liked. I would recommend that anyone who doesn't like AA keep on trying to find a chill meeting. They are out there and totally worth it.

I would have gone to more meetings in my second year. I don't regret not going, but it would have been more fun if I could celebrate this anniversary with other people in recovery.

The second year was better than the first. It was faster, and I didn't think about drinking as much as I did the first year. I got all of my feelings back. I became more spiritual.

That was the only meeting I attended for my first couple months of being sober, but then moved to a new town and haven't looked for meetings where I am now. Having that resource when I needed it, though, was so incredible, and I really appreciated the love and support everyone showed me. "
3n0xr0,cvjukr0,soufflee,2015-09-30 17:33:20,"I don't go to SMART but at the AA meetings I attend there are typically more men than women present. 

Maybe more men than women are alcoholics? Maybe alcoholism is less stigmatized for men than for women? Maybe the recovery community is like reddit?

Maybe someone (meaning not me) could study this."
3n0xr0,cvjvlvq,offtherocks,2015-09-30 18:02:17,"It's been studied. Women are less likely to seek treatment for an addiction problem.  AA's not really doing women any favors here, either.  Many meetings are predatory environments.

1.5 years ago this sub was about 2/3 male, 1/3 female.  That's more or less in line with the overall reddit demographic.  I feel like we have a lot more women around than we used to. I wouldn't be surprised if that gap has closed."
3n0xr0,cvk4msp,tallwindycitychik,2015-09-30 22:22:05,"As a female, can I ask why we are preyed upon? "
3n0xr0,cvk58uy,offtherocks,2015-09-30 22:41:46,"Newcomers are often at a low point in their lives and thus vulnerable, most AA members are men, many are lonely and have a cockeyed view of relationships, no one ends up at AA as a result of exhibiting a pattern of making good decisions, and good people often sit quiet while bad things happen.

It's no secret that AA has this problem. Google around. [Here's one article @ the fix.](http://www.thefix.com/content/13th-step)  The most ancient & wise DINOS who've been around the program for decades will tell you the same thing.  It is not at all uncommon.  The good guys do what they can to keep it out of their homegroups, but they can't be everywhere.

We see it here on SD, both on the sub and in IRC.  Last week a male posted a thread asking for ladies to identify themselves.  Most people who responded thought OP was a she. Nope. Had they clicked his username they'd have seen the dick-pics he's posted elsewhere on reddit.  One with the title, ""Ladies, this thing needs attention.""  We have men show up to IRC and do nothing but PM with women, 
we've had complaints about PM harassment, about lewd photos, you name it, we've seen it. We had one guy try to blackmail a girl.  

We do what we can to keep it at bay.  raevie & the rest of the ops do a great job of bouncing the pervs outta IRC.  But they just keep coming.   
"
3n0xr0,cvk8c3e,tallwindycitychik,2015-10-01 00:43:32,Wow. I didn't know all this. It's a sad thing especially when being in such a vulnerable state and trying to have the courage to open up. 
3n0xr0,cvk950e,offtherocks,2015-10-01 01:23:51,"I agree.  There's another important element that needs to be added  to paint a complete picture.  It's mentioned in that Fix article and we see the same thing here.   

Vulnerable people don't *know* that they're vulnerable, and they don't accept that they're vulnerable.  They all think, *I'm an adult, I can make my own choices!*  If you tell a vulnerable person to not talk to so-and-so, 90% are gonna do it anyway, if they want to. It feels good to have someone to talk to, and everyone likes to have someone take interest in them. It's part of what makes vulnerable people vulnerable in the first place.  

It makes it hard to police bad activity when it's not reported.  We don't usually hear about the first PM.  We hear about the 40th PM.  Because up until that time, the victim didn't object.  Ya can't blame the victim, they're vulnerable and they're not thinking clearly.  And they certainly didn't *invite* any nastiness by virtue of simply talking to someone.  

It goes the other way sometimes too.  Sometimes women prey on men.  

And sometimes it's the experienced person who ends up getting burned.    If we're going to assign fault anywhere though it has to fall on the more experienced person's shoulders. They should know better.

Everything gets all irrational and nutty where matters of the heart and gonads are involved.  It's best that new people avoid risky personal relationships altogether, even if everyone involved has the best of intentions.  But so few people do.

You're right though. I've seen a lot of predatory behavior at meetings.  They typically like to go for young, newly sober girls. I am lucky that I am ""older"" (mid 30s) and will speak my mind so stuff like that hasn't really happened to me. "

And to be fair, it's not just among the young AAs, sad to say that the same flaming assholes that were in the bars are in the meetings too, so women, only and men, only meetings are useful options."
3n0xr0,cvjw31q,VictoriaElaine,2015-09-30 18:15:39,"I'd say 2/3 male and 1/3 female in most of the groups I have seen. Same with inpatient. But my sample is limited to Ontario, Canada."

3n0xr0,cvk1eat,Sandbomb,2015-09-30 20:45:47,"I had that experience at AA and SMART both. I found it really hard to identify with a lot of the men because men and women are socialized so differently on how we internalize and express emotion. Ultimately I went to private counseling and then found a support group for women with PTSD. The therapy helped with my addiction while the support group gave me the emotional means to work through trauma I was masking with alcohol. 

For me anyway, being one of the only women in my area was a lonely and isolating experience. I realized because of that those meetings weren't working for me personally and found other pathes to fellowship."

3n0srp,cvjxqj1,NonnyMouse69,2015-09-30 19:02:07,"So, if I were in your situation, I'd be thinking about the following things: 

Why did I quit drinking in the first place? 

Why did I find a subreddit called /r/stopdrinking?  

What happens when I drink?  

What are the costs/benefits of quitting?

Will I be capable of choosing a soda or tea instead of beer at this dinner?  If not, can I invite my friends to a location that doesn't serve alcohol, so I don't have the temptation?

That, off the top of my head is where I'd be at.  


For me, I take 24 hours at a time...sometimes just an hour...or 10 minutes at a time.  I've been pretty open and honest on this subreddit...and I've been through some serious life crap in the course of the past 493 days since my first /r/stopdrinking post.  I have grown to accept that the blessings I've found in sobriety are well worth keeping, and I'd lose a lot if I went back to drinking.  

I am not a person who can moderate.  Maybe for a few days...maybe a few weeks...I'd focus on whatever alcoholic algebra formula I'd create on how many drinks I'd allow myself...but inevitably, the numbers would creep up.  I don't want to be back into that horrible cycle again.  

So, yes.  For me, it is all, or nothing.  If I give up on staying sober, I will lose everything.  I don't want to be the person I used to be when drunk all the time.  

"
3n0srp,cvjt8a7,socksynotgoogleable,2015-09-30 16:57:08,"I think it depends on the person. Some people are able to moderate and some aren't. If you're here, you might be one of the latter.

In my experience, quitting 100% is much easier than quitting 95%. Not ruling out drinking completely left me bargaining with myself, obsessing over when I could drink again, inventing situations in which to drink, basically just cheating my own system. The mental fatigue wasn't worth it to me."
3n0srp,cvk5i1n,WorldsSmartestGeraff,2015-09-30 22:50:15,"I gave moderation one last shot this past weekend. I told myself no more bourbon, just beer, and that the 12-pack I bought on Saturday would last until at least Wednesday. But I woke up Sunday to 12 empty cans in the trash. All or nothing, I did not drink today and I intend to do the same tomorrow.

Being sober always brought me face to face with all the personal stuff, the good, the bad, and the ugly, that I swept away in a haze.

3n0iih,cvjqud7,coolcrosby,2015-09-30 15:56:17,"Welcome /u/CenturiesChild to r/stopdrinking.  In my opinion one of the least important things to getting sober turns out to be figuring out if you drank enough to benefit from stopping drinking.  The most important thing was stopping drinking and staying stopped long enough to have sufficient clarity about your relationship with alcohol so you could actually figure out if it makes sense to stay stopped.  In other words with 30, 60 or even 90 days sober you can have all kinds of insights that you can't get to just by saying I drank x amount over x number of days.  You see, we are all a little bit different while ironically, we are all a lot alike.  Frankly, I finally figured out that I was an alcoholic not by seeing how much I drank but through the realization that even when I wasn't drinking, I was thinking about drinking.  

So at this [link is a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which describes exactly what I did to stop drinking and stay stopped.  Why don't you see if any of the ideas there make any sense to you?  Good luck."

However, your drinking is causing you problems in that you're doing it alone, it's exhausting and it's taking up a lot of brain space.

I recall Damien Hirst said something once about his alcohol issues. He said something along the lines of 'once you're not drinking to celebrate, but to escape, then its time to give it some thought'.

That's definitely what I'm doing."

If you feel like it's not benefiting you, then don't do it.  It's that simple.  :)

I personally love being sober, and that's quite a bold statement coming from someone who used to think being drunk was my ideal state.  I used to date a guy from Scotland, so I understand how much drinking is part of the culture over there (...we had a lot of arguments regarding that because he was not supportive of my getting sober).  If you feel better not drinking, don't do it, and don't worry about what others say or thing, or what is ""normal"".  :) "

3v7ec8,cxl0jgj,DamagedGoods812,2015-12-02 17:39:39,"You'd be surprised. I generally only drink because I'm bored. But, when I'm in a relationship, it never crosses my mind. I'll go 6 months without a drop and never even realize it."
3v7ec8,cxkzd8f,SOmuch2learn,2015-12-02 17:08:54,"Since you are concerned about your drinking, you belong. I am glad you're here. Like you, my tolerance was very high. I didn't realize it's a symptom of alcoholism. Dating is not a recommended treatment for a problem with alcohol. "
3v7ec8,cxkzj8o,Ihearcolor,2015-12-02 17:13:07,"In my experience, dating and things of such nature are only distractions. I tried for a long time to keep busy and fill my life with things that kept me away from booze, but it wasn't until I dealt with the issues that lead me to drink in the first place that I was able to put down the bottle and be ok. Eventually, I'd run out of things to do or keep me occupied and I went straight back to the bottle. A more helpful solution, in my opinion, is finding positive ways to cope with stress from work and home situation (counseling, therapy, SMART, AA etc...). Best of luck my friend, stay strong. "
3v7ec8,cxkzpb7,sunjim,2015-12-02 17:17:31,"Thinking that something outside of me would *make* me stop (or make me *want* to stop) drinking--and waiting for that thing to show up--kept me at it until I was 50. 

Rather than relieving stress, drinking (and the after-effects) make it harder to deal with work. Maybe taking a break--for a month at least so you can really experience not drinking--would help you sort this out. "
3v79is,cxkxs1b,perfectlyordinary,2015-12-02 16:30:01,"Oh yes, I felt this way! It makes sense... alcohol was my substitute for friends and interests. Once alcohol was gone I realized ""hey, it didn't used to matter to me that I had no friends or interests....but now it does."" It is a very blah/unpleasant feeling, but I don't think it's a bad thing, it's kinda like I was coming to life again after a really long hibernation. It didn't feel right at first because I wasn't used to it. I started shyly seeking out other people, social events, activities I hadn't tried before... it was terrifying at first because I was sober... and yes, lots of feelings came up I wasn't used to dealing with. Just tried not to panic and keep sailing. Rinse and repeat. :)"
3v79is,cxkx84o,treesandclouds,2015-12-02 16:16:53,"It might sound facetious, but really time just eventually passed like it always does.

I exercised and played guitar which helped to a certain extent, but in my experience there's only so much you can do to fight the blues. 

And honestly, I think accepting it kind of helped. Sometimes you feel blah and depressed and that's ok. It will pass."
3v79is,cxl01vg,SOmuch2learn,2015-12-02 17:26:43,"Depression is common during the early days of sobriety. I had a therapist and went to lots of AA meetings. A sponsor and working the steps helped fill time and was an excellent personal growth experience. I stayed busy with work, exercise, and raising two children. "
3v79is,cxl0o1m,Nika65,2015-12-02 17:42:58,"40 days?   Very common to go through these periods during these times.  Keep working and moving forward, it definitely gets better!   Good luck. "
3v77g6,cxkwwtg,treesandclouds,2015-12-02 16:09:24,"I'm convinced resets are an integral part of the process. I know it took me more times than it should have to learn the lesson that for me ""just one occasionally"" always eventually turns into ""all the time"".

Congratulations on 185 days! That's a lot of days!"
3v77g6,cxkxbui,kilayo,2015-12-02 16:19:22,"I definitely agree! When I see people reset their counters I am sad for them, and then I remember how many times it took me to 'get it'. Probably about 10 years of stopping and starting...

3v73ob,cxkvhbr,treesandclouds,2015-12-02 15:36:50,It really depends on your relationship with your roommate. There is a small handful of people in my life I would feel comfortable bringing something like that up with. With most people I think I would just make them upset and defensive.
3v73ob,cxkvx6x,squawd,2015-12-02 15:46:46,"That's the problem... We have only lived together for about six months. Her mom owns our house, so her not holding a job isn't a big deal to me BC her mom enables her to drink (though I think her mom is unaware of the problem). We aren't that close, although she isolates herself so she may consider us closer than I do. I have tried to bring it up, but catching her sober is impossible. I cant even give her my rent money without leaving her a note or sending her a text to remind her because she wont know where the money came from after one of her five midday naps. As someone who has struggled in this area, I really feel for her and worry. I also feel that it might not be my place. Then I wonder, if it isn't my place, whose place is it? I dont think its right to watch her waste away, losing weight and unable to gauge time long term. "
3v73ob,cxl0b11,Ihearcolor,2015-12-02 17:33:28,"That's a tough situation. If I were in your shoes I'd try being a friend first. Maybe invite her to do something non-alcohol related that could keep her from drinking for a while. Then, after a while of establishing a friendship and some trust I would invite her to a meeting or somehow share my own struggles with alcohol or find a gentle way to bring up her drinking. Obviously, the best thing you can do is to set the example by continuing to stay sober and live your life as best as possible. "
3v73ob,cxkz8fh,startingmp,2015-12-02 17:05:27,"I think people have to want to change themselves and become defensive when their ""flaws"" are brought to their attention.

That's exactly how I've experienced it.  It's why we do this whole deal one day at a time.  Forever is IMPOSSIBLE early on when you feel this way, it's a sure set up for failure.  So we challenge ourselves to not drink TODAY,  only."

Sounds like me! Let's hang in there, for me the first week is the hardest but it gets much easier on the cravings after that. The ""voice"" and mind games are tricky though!

I'm hoping that this will be the first Christmas with a picture of me without a beer in my hand, could become a ""collector's item"""
3v72hl,cxkxanj,FrankiePinewater,2015-12-02 16:18:34,"Good luck :)
I want to make it a tradition at my place to host a Thanksgiving dinner for family and friends every year the Sunday after the official US Thanksgiving holiday.  I live in a country where Thanksgiving isn't celebrated, so it's kind of a special thing for me.  Of course the First Annual Pinewater Thanksgiving Dinner devolved into drunken assholery between me and another beer weasel buddy.  So 2nd Annual Pinewater Thanksgiving, I want to celebrate one year sober.  I know that this is a one day at a time thing, but I'm not sure it will mess me up to have that as a secondary goal."
3v72hl,cxkwbt9,ninjilla,2015-12-02 15:55:57,"When I got the itch for a beer in early sobriety, I cracked open a can of sparkling water. My brain was pretty stupid and believed it was getting what it wanted...liquid, carbonation, cold, yes....satisfaction. No more craving."

It is the only way it works, not drinking today.

3v6v1u,cxkuvck,coolcrosby,2015-12-02 15:23:18,"First, you can see the [2014 Survey Results.](https://www.reddit.com/2oxmxi)  Then if you are extremely interested in the subject why don't you look at [the Natural History of Alcoholism, Revisited by Vaillant](http://www.amazon.com/The-Natural-History-Alcoholism-Revisited/dp/0674603788)"
3v6v1u,cxktxky,FreeFromMorgan,2015-12-02 15:02:25,"I saw a graph on here once that I can't find now but it was number of days at badge reset, not super accurate at all but it did gradually go down with number of days but peaked on anniversary dates. (One year, 18 months, 2 years etc)"
3v6v1u,cxkvx2q,SOmuch2learn,2015-12-02 15:46:42,"In general, the likelihood of relapse is the same as it is for other chronic diseases such as heart disease, asthma, arthritis, diabetes and cancer--50%. Following medical recommendation to the ""T"" for these diseases lessens the probability of relapse. However, we find it difficult to do this, hence recovery is compromised. [I'm looking for the source where I saw this statistic.]"
3v6v1u,cxkwdj0,socksynotgoogleable,2015-12-02 15:56:59,"Try searching for the Rand Corporation study ""The Course of Alcoholism."" It followed 900+ alcoholics for 4 years, tracking recovery and relapse. The numbers aren't pretty, so don't get too stuck on them. It's difficult to take 900 individuals and draw any single conclusion from them, but it's downright crazy to then take that conclusion and try to extrapolate it back to one individual's chances. So take it with a big old salt crystal."
3v6t40,cxktcsv,treesandclouds,2015-12-02 14:49:22,"I was worried too at first. Turns out there was nothing to be worried about. Invariably things went like this:

*Scene: At a party. Or whatever.*

Friend: ""Can I get you a beer.""

Me: ""Nah, I'm good.""

Friend: ""Ok.""

*Later that night*

Friend: ""Come on and do this shot!""

Me: Nah, I'm good.""

Friend: ""Why not???""

Me: ""I'm not really drinking these days.""

Friend: (Doubtfully) ""We'll see!""

*Much later on. Days or weeks. Again at a party. Or whatever.*

Friend: ""Can I get you a beer.""

Me: ""Nah, I'm good.""

Friend: ""Are you still not drinking???""

Me: ""Yup.""

Friend: ""Huh. Good for you man. I should probably cut back myself.""

I maybe got some good-natured teasing along the way, but it really wasn't a problem for me. 

My advice would be to not make a big deal out of it, answer any questions they have honestly, and make it about you, not them. (Some of my friends should probably cut back on their drinking but unless they ask me I won't tell them that.)"
3v6t40,cxktkop,EarthToBrint,2015-12-02 14:54:18,This is my experience 99% of the time. I think it's cool how we are setting a positive example for our peers and showing them that life can be enjoyed without alcohol :)

3v6t40,cxktbzl,anonymous_zebra,2015-12-02 14:48:50,"I've had friends that quit drinking and they just flat-out said ""I choose not to drink now because it was becoming a problem."" No one argued or tried to pressure them to drink after that and it was fine. If they judge you for it, then you probably shouldn't socialize with them further. It's friends that have a problem themselves that are the ones to watch out for because they often don't want to admit they have a problem.. misery loves company, as they say."
3v6t40,cxkte35,EarthToBrint,2015-12-02 14:50:12,"I was an obnoxious asshat around my friends when I drank. When I stopped drinking and they noticed, they asked ""why"" and I answered ""You guys have been my friends long enough, you guys know exactly why"" and we shared a laugh and got back to what we were doing. Real friends won't ditch you because you don't want to drink any more.

This was a little further in my sobriety when I finally felt comfortable. If you aren't at that point, feel free to make an excuse. "
3v6t40,cxktf3h,startingmp,2015-12-02 14:50:50,"So for me, a big social occasion would not be the right time to start an in-depth convo about my sobriety. I would personally carry a glass of soda so my non-drinking would not be noticed. If someone noticed, I would say ""I'm not drinking tonight"" or ""I have (something) early"" or ""I'm taking a break"" or whatever. I'm a private person and believe that my choices should be shared only when and with whom I want to share it.  If you do share privately with people you trust beforehand, they will be less likely to hound you about it "

To these I say ""I just wanna do some more good than harm for a bit"" and change the subject. No one's pressed me much after that."

It's $30-35 a month (depending on what state you're in, I think?), so if I see even just 3 movies a month I'm saving some dough. Still a luxury, but might want to check it out too if you used to see movies in theaters a lot more often :)

Still, running directly from Toy Story and *just* making it to see Seven, is an experience I'll cherish forever. That was one hell of a day.

So monthly $60-80 in liquor and $36 - $48 in beer. So, rounding around $130/month just with what I was bringing home and as you say drinks out at restaurants/bars maybe another $100 or so. 

Call it $250/month, $3,000 a year.

I spent THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR to slowly kill myself all so I could get high, satisfy my brain's need for this hyper-pleasure state, and escape problems that never went away.

I bought half gallons for home a few times a week. I also always had beer. Throw in video poker (here in Oregon they're in every bar), and it added up fast.

I did all the math when I was in treatment. They had me add up what I spent, as well as ancillary stuff like gambling, and lost work time. Fortunately I didn't have any of the latter, but I definitely gambled when I was drinking. Mainly because I was bored.

When you add the cost of treatment or law troubles, alcohol can be really costly. These are costs I incurred that normal people don't."

As an alcoholic, I have trouble thinking as if I were a ""normal drinker"". But that is because I've always been an alcoholic. 

My opinion is that there is nothing wrong with alcohol. Just because *I* cannot drink responsibility doesn't mean no one else can, and I need to be careful about projecting my own issues onto others. "

Others say that it is a progressive disease and it gets worse over time.

I'm inclined to think that there are 3 types.... those who are born alcoholic (me), those who start drinking normally and it progresses into alcoholism, and those who can drink ""normally"" for their entire life."
3v67qh,cxkozt3,Wholelife34,2015-12-02 13:11:58,"I can go with that thinking. So then 2 of those 3 types are in essence either already or progressing into alcoholism .  Where is that line? I don't identify in traditional terms of alcoholic but I know I want more as soon as I start and that is a problem. I top out at 4 and go to bed. I don't have any life issues from my drinking but I recognize that it is getting worse and want to stop before I go there. 

If I were to go off my opinion on where the ""problem"" drinking starts, I would venture to say you have about 20% type 1, 60% type 2, and 20% type 3.  That means I believe that 80% of drinkers are actually alcoholics whether they were born that way or are progressing.  

It's interesting non the less. Clearly there is a definite level on what we consider alcoholic but I think that problem arises early on in the 60% bunch and if it were recognized early on instead of being brushed off as normal, a lot us wouldn't be in this boat. Overall, what is keeping me going is that if I only think I ever had a 20% chance of being a ""normal"" drinker, I don't want those odds."

I'm down a ton of weight and am at the gym regularly. I'm starting to see gains and definition. LOVING what I'm seeing. Hoping to drop another 40 of fat in the next six or seven months.

About a year in, I started working out more regularly. I run on trails, between 6 and 13 miles depending on how my knees feel and what else I've been doing that day. It started as a ""get closer to naturegod thing"" and has grown in distance since I started out exhausted and walking after 2 miles. I'm down a bit more now, hovering around 170 and I'm so close to ab cuts, I can taste it >.< .

Would never have started running outside without sobriety. There's no TV to keep the angry noise mute. And I could never stick to a workout regime when I was drinking, between being intoxicated, being hungover, and having that lazy spiritually sick attitude."
3v5x6r,cxl15wl,PhishHeadNJ,2015-12-02 17:56:18,"I gained a lot of weight. I was super depressed when I stopped, and I ate ice cream (like a whole pint of Ben & Jerry's) every single night for a few months!

3v5wui,cxkogpt,jrmax,2015-12-02 12:59:22,"Agreed.  Drive and use that as an excuse not to drink.  Or say you're on antibiotics... which can also give you an excuse to head home early if you're not feeling well.

In fact, TONIGHT, is my holiday party. And I am management and expected to go. And another manager already texted me wanting to have a toast the second I walk in the door (still trying to figure that one out).

Technically, I could be fired for skipping. Probably won't, but I have had to fire people for missing mandatory meetings before (which this is considered for management) so I know our company MIGHT do it. To me, that stress outweighs the diplomatic dancing I might have to do. 

Some people might advice you to not go. Or that ""you don't have to go if you don't want to."" Only you can decide if your job or sobriety is more important. At this point in my life, it's my job. (Not an excuse to drink, just to have to be around booze). And I also know, that if my stress level skyrockets from skipping, whether or not I get fired, that will be a bigger trigger for me.

Good luck."

If you're in AA go to a meeting beforehand and hit one up on the way home, additionally talk to your sponsor or others that are in recovery. There are many alcoholics who have had to or are going to be a part of at least one work/social gathering where lots of alcohol is being served and it's expected that you'll be in attendance. The Serenity prayer, 12 Steps of AA and knowledge that others like me are going through similar situations helps me get through."

Bravo for a half century of days!"
3v5wn1,cxkly77,Giasone_3,2015-12-02 12:02:00,"Thanks.  Great to see you again too!

Also, thanks for the advice.  I definitely know and remember what happens when I drink. I also know that despite me having changed my outlook on life and my thought processes etc., nothing about my body chemistry or the characteristics of alcohol have changed in 500 days, so I do know very clearly that one drink would lead me right back where I was 500 days ago.  Sure, probably not immediately but I've seen enough people with more than 500 days post about a relapse that spun their lives out of control. 

I meant that I used to think about drinking or not drinking pretty much all my waking hours when I was stuck in the world of addiction.  Even after I had stopped for a while, I still thought about it a lot.  Now, while it's impossible not to think about something, I just don't have the thoughts anymore and thankfully my desire/urge/cravings have long since left me.  Again, I do understand that it can all change very quickly with a drink but thankfully that's not even remotely on my mind."

3v5ibg,cxkot2i,OspreySoaring,2015-12-02 13:07:36,"I feel you, Ive received the ultimatums too.    
When I got serious (and it's been start/stop last few weeks) about sobriety, i sought help. Found a therapist, was honest with my wife, active in StopDrinking, tried an AA meeting, bought books and changed habits. The seriousness of this is that my wife doesnt want to see me destroy myself, becoming shell of who they fell in love with. She doesnt want to expose kids to my toxic behavior. I get that. I understand when she says my behavior makes her think divorce is right option because it's an awful pain that's over as opposed to ringside seat to my destruction. She has stress too but doesnt checkout. She hates being onky adult in room especially when I cant help with chires, homework, etc.  These talks are what I replay when i get the craving. Then i think of the great (SOBER!) memories I have with family that i dont want to lose.     

I dont know your dynamics but I'm willing to wager this isnt a unique event but a straw breaking a camel's back. R/divorce would say ""dont leave the marital home"" but I cant comment on separation tactics. My guess is you and she should have the proverbial come to jesus meeting. Apologies are required and needed but if there's hope, you'll need an action plan she can agree to. Couples therapy and maybe al-anon or similar. I'm sure she's way more hurt than angry.   

Best of luck, you can do this if you want it. "

I know It could have gone a lot deeper but thankfully i soon started moving up.  I realized that I had to get sober FOR MYSELF.   I had to stop trying to sober up for other people.  I started going to meetings and actually doing the steps.  I also entered an inpatient rehab for 7 weeks voluntarily.  I really needed this because I knew I couldn't stop purely by my own will.  I needed to essentially lock myself up in a rehab where there was no chance I could get my hands on booze.  I didn't trust myself at all.  The time in rehab was needed and when i came out I had enough clarity to start working on things in my life that needed to change in order to stay sober.  I had a long way to go and needed help so I got a sponsor.  Someone who knew what I was going through and seemed to have conquered it.  From then on life has been gradually getting better and easier.  It did end with a divorce but I'm okay with that, I am however a real father now and have built a solid and new relationship with my children and my ex.  I see them all the time and am a huge part of their lives.  When I was drinking I was not although we lived under the same roof.  None of this just happened though.  It took a lot of work and time and meant confronting and changing a lot of character flaws but I'm so happy I took the steps and stuck with them.   My bottom was where I made it.

You also need to address reasons why you drink, the 12 steps could be really useful adressing these. It's almost always (was for me) some kind of void we are trying to fill (no pun intended). Addressing that very issue will get us into lasting and happy sobriety.

Also, don't feel like you have to say ""Hi I'm this_a_username and I'm an alcoholic."" You don't. You can just say your name and share. Other people say it because they feel certain that they're alcoholics, but it's not required.

3v52hj,cxkg7cb,this_a_username,2015-12-02 09:43:13,"This has really confused me. People who are alcoholics vs. people who abuse alcohol. I drink too much and I need to seek help for it, would that not automatically make me an alcoholic?

Not trying to be contrary, I just really don't get it. Because I haven't seriously sought help for this before, I am new to the vocabulary and methods for combatting the drinking. So, just to warn you, I might have a lot of questions. :)"
3v52hj,cxkjif7,drnkgrngo,2015-12-02 11:05:12,"I know, it's a tough distinction. The AA book helps a lot with understanding the difference. For instance if my friend's girlfriend dumps him, and he starts drinking heavily for the next year or so, although he never had a problem before is he suddenly an alcoholic?

This is from something I posted previously, and it helps to describe what my personal form of alcoholism is like. Keep in mind everyone is different.

>For me it has the astonishing power of something like a black hole, where I start off fine on the light side and then imperceptibly slide into the abyss until I'm just tanked pretty much constantly and maintenance drinking throughout the day to avoid withdrawl. I have quit before only to start again confidently and have the same thing happen. It's like nothing else I've ever experienced, the power of this outright addiction to lead me to total self-abandon with such consistency. It's never happened with any other substance I've used (and I've dabbled my fair share).
In my experience, this mystifying, balls-to-the-wall takeover that alcohol manifests in certain people is one form of true alcoholism, where it really is totally out of your control and will lead you to insanity or death if you don't get help. My life has become unthinkably grim at times because of alcohol, and I have acted in ways I knew were crazy for long, sustained periods of time but I couldn't stop because.. well, that's the mystifying part.

It doesn't have to be as extreme as this, but if you REALLY want to stop and you just CAN. NOT. STOP. then your problem is significant. If you have repeatedly tried to drink like a ""normal"" person and not get drunk, but couldn't control your intake, that's another good indicator.

Sorry if this still leaves everything unclear. The Big Book has way better descriptions! Try reading chapter 3; it really spoke to me. Also, PM me if you ever want to talk about any of this stuff more in depth!"

But here's what I can tell you: alcohol was FAR MORE a cause of my anxiety than a solution. 

Good lord I wish I had figured that out sooner! 

I was ""self medicating"" my anxiety... with the PRIMARY CAUSE of my anxiety. 

Think about that for a moment. 

My anxiety has gone from a 9/10 to maybe a 2/10. I'm back off my ssri, and no problem.

3v52hj,cxkd3uf,this_a_username,2015-12-02 08:10:23,"I totally agree about alcohol causing anxiety. It's definitely a vicious cycle. I am anxious, I drink, I then sit in bed at night obsessing over how I'm slowly killing my body and wasting evenings being buzzed. 

A comprehensive plan is a really good suggestion. My plans thus far have been: I'm just not going to drink from now on. It's not been working out. I am also good at hiding my high intake, and during the day I'm functional, clean, and successful in my field, and I don't like going out to bars, so I don't think many people know that I struggle when I get home at night. I think being up front with some friends and family might really help. 

Honestly, just posting this and discussing this with people that have gone through similar issues with alcohol makes me feel much more hopeful. I have been very much dealing with this alone."

I managed to stop with the help of Antabus - I don't think I would have gotten through the first few weeks without it. During the first weeks I tried to stay busy and do stuff I hadn't done because of drinking, like cleaning my home and doing laundry etc. I also did puzzles and knitting - whatever to take my mind of drinking and giving me something to do. I also started to run again, which I hadn't done when I was drinking daily, and it's been awesome to notice how much better shape I am in. 

It didn't take that long for me to notice that I was actually less anxious when I wasn't drinking. It's astounding, really, how much more manageable my anxiety is now that I don't drink. Drinking only takes it away for a few hours,  but when it comes back it's a lot worse than it would be without drinking.  Also, I take medication for my anxiety and depression, and drinking alcohol lessens their effect considerably.

Writing a journal has also been a good way for me to deal with different emotions."

I think it would really help me to start making a list of non-drinking related activities that I could do when I get the urge, and journaling is a great idea! 

In regards to Antabus, not sure if I'm ready for that just yet, but I think if I try steps like counseling, journaling, non-drinking activities, etc...and still need extra help, I might have to consider it.

3v52hj,cxkg2cq,haunteddollwatch,2015-12-02 09:39:36,"My advice to you would be to reach out to someone you know in real life, either a family member/parent or friend. You don't even have to say HELP ME, you could say, ""I'm worried about how much I drink."" I told my mom, and it helped tremendously to have someone who at least knew that I was struggling.

In the past, I've stopped for a week and then slowly started up again, telling him that I am just drinking moderate amounts. I fear if I tell him I really want to stop now, he won't take me seriously. It's a girl who cried ""alcoholic"" one too many times scenario.

But maybe, as others have recommended, if I actually had a plan to show him on how I would stop, he wouldn't be so frustrated with my constant stopping and starting, because I'll actually have a plan to combat it."

3v52hj,cxknrin,Giasone_3,2015-12-02 12:43:20,"Welcome to SD and asking for help was a very important step for me.

I was able to quit by really changing my perception of alcohol.  Reading Allen Carr's book referenced in the sidebar and Jack Trimpey's rational recovery website helped me to start changing my perception but neither of them got me to quit permanently as I always went back to drinking.  

Once I found SD, I spent hours a day on here, mostly reading other's posts and histories.  I found it amazing that I could find someone's first post and then read through their journey and figure out what works and what does not work and what will work for me.  It served two purposes, one, I wasn't drinking when I was reading and, more importantly, I really got educated about alcohol abuse and addiction.

Now, to keep myself from drinking and maintain my happiness, I know I need to keep my life in order and my stresses in check etc.  Therefore, I set goals regularly and seek to achieve them.  Also, for my daily physical and mental well being, I do my transcendental meditation twice a day and exercise six days a week (and even when I am not exercising, I have my fitbit and make sure I get my five miles and 25 floors in every day).

Good luck!"
3v52hj,cxkoppa,Iwonttakeitanymore,2015-12-02 13:05:21,"For me, I quit because I got tired of myself. I just didn't want to be that person any more and finally after 15 years I was able to get over myself finally and start down the sober road.

I have to say that the reason I've been so successful, even after [coming close to throwing it all away](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3uhwut/i_won_again_today/) recently was due in part to understanding why I needed to drink. 

It was surprising to find out that my need to drink did not stem from wanting to relax or even fit in with the crowd or to celebrate this or that. My need to drink stemmed from my own cultivation of a part of my brain that wants to feel the pleasure associated with being drunk. 

This [book](http://www.amazon.com/Rational-Recovery-Cure-Substance-Addiction/dp/0671528580/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1449081923&sr=8-1&keywords=jack+trimpey) is wholly instrumental in helping me answer the question of why I needed it and did it. 

We humans weren't designed to be in such a heightened state of pleasure that drugs and alcohol give us. Once we start to drink or do drugs, some of us turn on this part of our brain and all it wants is the next drink or the next high and it doesn't care how it gets it even if it kills you in the process. 

Knowing this helped me understand where the cravings were coming from and why I felt so anxious when I didn't have any alcohol close by. It was that part of the brain wanting, needing and pressuring me into fulfilling the need. The longer I waited the stronger the feeling gets. That book helped me face that part of my brain and work with changing that part of my brain. 

Still, it wasn't easy. Not in the beginning. I had to constantly fight that voice over and over again. I had to use words like NEVER as in I will never drink again. 

It's a funny thing saying that. Ask anyone who has a problem with alcohol to use that phrase and ask them how it makes them feel. Sad, angry, anxious, sick, those were my feelings when I first start using it. 

But you don't have to start at never, you can work up to it with this: I will not drink today. That is a little less scary. Just today, I will not drink. The next morning you tell yourself again and on and on until you've strung 30, 60, 90 days together. You get on a roll and before you know it a year has passed.

I wish I could tell you that the voice that compels you to drink eventually shuts up and dies, but it doesn't. It'll quiet down and leave you alone sometimes for long stretches of times, but eventually it'll try again with you. Maybe it'll slide in a, ""Hey, you've been doing well with not drinking, why not celebrate with ONE beer or ONE glass of wine."" It can get pretty nasty with you too telling you things like it's stupid to want to be sober and that eventually you'll fail, everyone knows it, so go on an drink, damn you!

Sounds crazy, doesn't it? But I am sure some SDers know what I am talking about. That stupid, fucking voice!

Lastly, the greatest ally you have in wanting to quit is you. You have to want it for you. You can't say I am going to quit for my boyfriend or husband of new baby or fourteen year old, etc. This is a cross you must bear and you have to take it with the utmost seriousness. 

This doesn't mean you have to go it alone. If you think AA will help, go and follow the program. If you thinks SMART Recovery will work, work that program. If you think reading the book that helped me would be the way, do it! I'll even send you my copy of it. And of course, you have a great community here at /r/stopdrinking. 

Time to take your power back /u/this_a_username. You've freely gave it away to a substance that doesn't care a lick whether you live or die. Now freely take it back and leave drinking in your past. 

Today, you will not drink. 

Day 1 starts now."
3v52hj,cxkpiyr,this_a_username,2015-12-02 13:24:21,"Thanks for the recommendation, I will try out that book and see if it aids in my recovery. You hit the nail on the head. Thinking, ""I will never drink again,"" makes me feel anxious, like I'm losing a huge comfort in life, which is so ridiculous, I know. The voice often tells me, ""you've had a hard day, what's so wrong with unwinding at night?"" Or the voice tries to rationalize, saying ""Your life isn't falling apart, you have a loving partner, a career, family and friends, you don't REALLY have a problem."" But I know that it is all absolute bull. I DO have a problem. 

You are right. Today, I will not drink. "
3v52hj,cxkqacr,Iwonttakeitanymore,2015-12-02 13:41:36,"Fighting that voice is the hardest part in the beginning I think. It's what sabotages a lot of people because it can get down right maddening until you feel you HAVE to drink in order to have any peace of mind.

Along with identifying and fighting that voice another thing that helped me was to totally restructure how I thought about alcohol. Once my buddy and friend, it sickens me now to think about it. I have cultivated such a deep hatred of it now it's on a visceral level. I don't want it in my life any more, ever. 

I have no reservations telling you that I know that you can do this if it's something YOU really want to do. It won't be easy, but, yes, it is totally worth it. Find a program that works and do it. Doesn't matter what it's called. If it works for you, you've found the right program."
3v52hj,cxkrwr9,OspreySoaring,2015-12-02 14:17:31,"I'll echo what many others have said before about everyone's ""plan"" is unique and what works for some won't for others...maybe yours won't even work for you all the time and need to find other/addl options. Also, don't get hung up on AA too much, search for posts on it here. Many people post a ""my first w/AA meeting"" type review. I did. There's also SMART and Rational Recovery.   

Labels are not necessarily the end all be all. Admitting you're an alcoholic can be powerful or nothing at all. What's important is you seek a change and want improvement. Same can be said for someone who is overweight, but not obese looking for diet & fitness changes. Whatever view doesn't cause you to reject deny your overall state will probably be more helpful?    

I know that what helps for me is therapist to approach negatives more positively. Actively participating in SD (lurking didn't cut it). Keeping with the daily pledge. Imagining results of drinking before taking first sip. Cherishing my sober & non-hungover moments to get stuff done work or home. I love not avoiding my wife so I can hide the smell. I'm getting back into my exercise routines. Even though I despise soda, I'll drink a sprite if I think of a beer (many here love carbonated beverage substitutes). And white knuckling it when the urge or craving gets too strong. Since you do this at night, it may be helpful to look for or pick (back) up hobbies you enjoyed?   

Best of luck in your journey.  "

The other day I heard (speakerphone) someone close to me saying that some recent pictures of me made them want to cry because I ""looked like teenage /u/ybahent"" (I am 29) and ""looked happy."" I think the teenage thing is because of some weight loss, but I am getting tons of comments from family about ""looking like your old self"" and people who aren't even aware of the drinking issue explicitly are telling me ""we missed you."" It's strange, and my responses vary. I try to be grateful about it first. But it is also harrowing/embarrassing/frightening to realize how profound the changes are.

it is a bit simpler and complicated than that.

Imagine you go to a tree and you tell it all you think about it, how ugly it is and blah blah blah. Does it changes the tree?

Now imagine you get a letter from who ever saying the same things about you, but you never read the letter. Will it affect you?

When we do read/hear other peoples **opinions/thoughts**, our minds... well, our minds have their own opinions and thoughts about other people's opinions and thoughts, and when we **believe** our own thoughts the problem arrives.

Someone tells us how beautiful and funny and smart we are, and we do not believe them, but the thoughts we have about their opinions. If we believe they are making fun of us is one thing, and if we believe they mean it, we walk happy for the next 30 mins or so.

Other people's opinion are like the rain. We decide what to do with **our** opinion about the rain (the rain won't stop because of our opinion about it): either we go like kids and dance under it, or we damn it because it ruins our plans for XXX....

As we get this, we can walk around hearing other people's opinion about us, but their opinions will not change who we are one single bit. It is only what we do with **our thoughts and opinions** about their thoughts and opinions which can have any effect in us.

Your rights end where someone else's begin. You have the right to get stupidly drunk as long as your actions aren't affecting anyone else. If your friends know about these embarrassing incidents you were not locked in a room alone but were instead out somewhere. You don't have the right to force people to just deal with you being super drunk.


> I find it so disrespectful to remind people of it and make fun of them for it, especially when it's something so dumb.

It's not disrespectful.  Everyone who does something stupid while drunk gets teased for it. You don't get a free pass. Actions have consequences. If you don't like people recounting stories of when you were embarrassingly drunk then don't get embarrassingly drunk.  Each time people see you holding a drink they'll be reminded of past incidents.  You're not doing yourself any favors here. 

> Thanks to all of these assholes now all I want is to get drunk. Fuck people.

People gonna peep. There isn't a damn thing you can do about their actions, views, perspectives, opinions or enlightenment. You are absolutely right... an adult has the right to drink themselves silly. But that right doesn't garauntee others can't respond in any manner they choose. 

The decision to quit,  for whatever reason, ultimately has to be about you. Your recovery has to be about you. Not a damn thing anyone else has to say about it, past, present or future has any impact on your recovery unless you allow it to. That doesn't mean it isn't going to hurt or make you angry though. How you respond (even internally) is actually your own decision. That can be like navigating a mine field until you get the hang of it. 

I don't know what these people are to you, but many here have also made the decision to remove toxic people from their lives. It's not always easy to come to that conclusion, but for some of us it had to be done for our own mental health. 

Hang in there friend :) No one outside of addiction is going to ""get it"". That's why I had to seek out like minded people who do to assist me in my recovery. There's also a lot to be said for sustained sobriety and what time *shows* others about our decision to quit. Some may not take it seriously until they see a lasting change in us.

Give it time.

I am assuming these people are friends and family.  They may be judging you, but so what?  I personally, deserved other people's judgement, to be honest.  I had made so many people miserable for so long, why would they have trusted me - with sobriety or anything for that matter?

You may not me remorseful about your past, but maybe some of the people in your life may still have resentments about things said or done in active addiction.  It wasn't until I was clean and sober for over a year before people started trusting me again."

Getting sober doesn't make those feelings go away or any less unpleasant to experience, but it does give you the ability to process them (rather than suppress them) and take action yourself to address the behaviour (yours or other people's) that causes them. 

Ultimately, you don't have to take anyone else's shit. If you find people toxic, you are entirely justified in protecting yourself. But one of the things I've discovered in sobriety is that it is often far easier to protect myself than I used to think: I can either change my reaction and perspective (if appropriate), or I can intervene to ask people to treat me differently (if they are worth the trouble and there is a chance they are hurting me through ignorance and carelessness), or I can simply distance myself by minimising contact.

It sounds as though the people around you don't understand the impact their comments are having on you. Rather than suffer in silence or stew in resentment, is there a way for you to tell them that they are not helping you? You may find that it's easier to assert yourself than you think. And if they continue to treat you in the same way after you ask them not to, then you can legitimately call it their problem and act accordingly."

I literally quit AA because after awhile the people in group ""made me"" want to drink. Best thing I could do was take a break. 

People do suck. Completely sometimes. But many, many people don't. I'm sorry your people do. 

This is a thing I STILL continue to struggle with myself sometimes. No one should ""have to"" apologize or pat me on the back for not drinking- I put myself in this position. But DAMN if I don't need them to sometimes, or AT LEAST to recognize the HUGE flipping effort this is for me. For them to trivialize it like I simply decided not to drink one kind of soda or something... Grrr... 

What you're doing is AMAZING. Truly special. And I know that it's hard, and a near-constant battle. I'm sorry your people don't know this. How could they? You get to set boundaries with them, and struggling with this doesn't mean you don't get to have expectations about them and how they treat you. They wouldn't make fun of you if you lost a leg- but they couldn't understand how your life had changed either. 

I think, for me, THIS is the biggest value for me of groups like this and other struggling connections as well. I don't choose to tell almost anyone about my decision to quit because I agree that most people can't handle that like a grown-up. But I have a couple of seriously supportive people in my life. I appreciate them, and they try to relate, but they just can't understand. Feel sorry for those people in your life. Sit down with them one on one and let them know how much of a-holes they're being and why you need them to change. Then, if they don't, they're out. Screw them. 

But do it when you've cooled off. :)

We're social animals who are biologically hardwired to care what others think, so I get how difficult it is to disregard the opinions of others as none of my business. That said, we also have the ability to recognize our emotions for what they are and manage them. Contemplating the opinions of others is absolutely counterproductive in terms of recovery. This process is entirely about you. The only selfish act that we alcoholics can do that is entirely positive is to quit drinking, and that isn't something that we are obligated to share with anyone else if we don't wish to. 

If people in your life find the state of your sobriety an interesting or amusing topic of casual conversation, **respectfully** tell them that you don't want to talk about it. Be firm, clear and consistent. You owe them no further explanation beyond ""I don't want to talk about it."" If they discuss your drinking among themselves while you are there, get up and leave or change the subject. Should they persist, tell them (again, in a calm and respectful fashion) that they are making you uncomfortable. That puts them on the defensive. 

Reputational recovery is a long process. People are going to talk shit for a while, but the important part is to shut it down when you can and ignore it when you can't. Out of sight will eventually mean out of mind. In the meantime, channel any negative emotions you have towards changing your life. Pick up a new hobby or skill.

It's nice to fly under the radar right now, no one can mock me if I'm sober :) and if they do, I have the level head to defend myself "
3v4s6r,cxkgwt6,randomquestion27,2015-12-02 10:01:24,"I totally relate to this anger.

For the record, I don't feel this anger anymore - so this, too, shall pass.

But I absolutely felt as angry at them as you do in this past.  It's like ""shut the goddam fuck up about my drinking/not drinking dammit!""

Like everyone has said: ""What other people do and say and think is none of my business.""  Well - exactly! Then why the fuck are all the fuckfaces talking, thinking, and obsessing over *your* drinking or not drinking?  

I feel you brotha!  Know that you won't feel this forever though.  For me, it lasted a bit over a year, and honestly, I still get annoyed (see my recent post) when random stranger-people want to talk about it with me randomly."

3v4s6r,cxkhwf5,SpiritWolfie,2015-12-02 10:26:14,"Wow I can totally relate.  I find it amazing how many people will easily point fingers at others in an attempt to not look at their own shit.  

During my really bad drinking days, way back in the 90s, there were a lot of people in my life like this and I thought we were all ""friends"".  However when I decided to get sober, I separated myself from them and learned how to live without alcohol.  I needed a break from their constant energy which I saw as very negative in my life and I needed input from others.  

I wanted to ""get my shit together"" and stop being blown by the winds.  I wanted to create a better life for myself but I didn't know how so I kept repeating familiar patterns of behavior and thought until I was able to finally see that my decisions were causing me pain. 

I had to realize my shitty life wasn't because of my friends teasing - it was because I kept choosing behaviors that didn't support who and what I wanted and KNEW I could be.  However, I also had to realize I couldn't BE that person unless I made some dramatic changes.  It was VERY hard to separate myself from my friends, at first, but it became easier as my life slowly started to improve.

I found a lot of help in making these changes in the rooms of Alcoholics Anonymous.  I spent 16.5 years in the program and many of those first few years were quite intense as I was learning a new way of life.  Very often I would engage in old patterns of thought and get lost but my AA sponsor, the meetings, my friends in the program and literature of AA would all help to bring me back on course.  

The great thing about AA is that they are a group of people that have experienced the kinds of humiliation and shame that goes along with unhealthy, alcoholic drinking.  For years before going to AA I was looking for help.  I tried self help books and tapes and went to seminars and such but no one really had all the answers....not even churches.

The thing I remember most from my VERY first meeting was that these people were talking as if they had lived the shit I was experiencing.  It was amazing.  Now the specifics of their stories were different than mine but I could tell - they KNEW how very painful and humiliating and shameful this lifestyle was.  That's the first time I had ever met someone who truly ""GOT IT""....that truly understood what I was going through.  And they didn't get it at an intellectual level like some detached shrink.  No they got it at a gut level, at a real level, at my level.

If you haven't tried AA yet, I would suggest you seriously consider it.  The issues you're describing are deep and painful and sometimes require a great deal of help to sort them out.  AA did this for me and the feeling of being free from such things is something that makes me forever grateful to AA.

I LOVE what one person in AA shared with me when I was going through a similar time as you.  She said, ""Look dude, those are just things that you have done.  That's not who you are.""  Man - that really helped me and I have meditated on that thought alone for a long, long time.

You don't have to keep living the life you're living if you don't want to - there is help available and I'm not talking about suicide.  I'm talking about real people that can help you change your life and live happy, joyous and free.

Here's a link to help you [find a meeting close to you](http://www.aa.org/pages/en_US/find-local-aa).  "

It's frustrating that the people we think should be our biggest supporters end up making us feel like an idiot for trying to do something to better ourselves. 

Here's my advice when you're angry as fuck: go on a run. get an angry fucking playlist and go. on. a. run. The worse it hurts, the better. Run away from them. Run away from the negativity. Run away from the judgement. No one has the authority to make you this angry, only you can do that. 

The best part about THIS one and precious amazing fucking life we have is that we get to choose who is in it with us. This is easier better said than done, but if these people do not contribute to your overall happiness than you're not obligated to keep them in your life. If they are family? Just don't give them much of your time. It is what it is. You don't have to announce that you're cutting off ties....just happily decline when they invite you out.

Most of all breathe! I think we've all been there that the anger, sadness, shame, and every other stupid emotion makes us feel like we're suffocating and we don't want to deal with them and therefore we want to drink. This too shall pass."

My only advice is to keep your head high! You're the one who realized their personal problem, and you are now doing your best to tackle it. People underestimate how hard it is to quite drinking. When it comes to people raising your past, just be real with them. Tell them that you would appreciate not being reminded of that time in your life because you're trying to move forward and become a better you. If they don't understand, you should reconsider the role they play in your life. "

I'm only 86 days sober at the moment, but all those feelings are washing away. My purpose in life is to find ways to continually improve and be of better service to those around me. I don't give a flying fuck if some people disagree with my approach (i.e. not consuming alcohol). I am the master of my own destiny. Full stop.

Keep in mind that many people simply don't understand what's it's like to be an alcoholic, because they are not. I'm sure that most of the people you mentioned in your post are not aware of how these comments hurt or upset you. Hang in there."

I turned to sleepytime teas. I'm sure there's a dozen varieties out there. Especially since it is cold now. The ritual of making myself the tea, and sipping a warm beverage as I wound down for the day really help get me ready for bed. 

Some people may recommend harder sleep aids. I found for myself that even OTC sleep aids hit me like a ton of bricks and even though yes, I would sleep through the night, I wouldn't feel rested the next day.

I've also had decent luck with melatonin supplements in the past. However, a side effect of them, and one that hit me **HARD** was very vivid dreams. Like I couldn't forget them for days. And if they were nightmares....oh boy that was rough. "

Yesterday I had intense stomach pains and threw up. I realised that this was my very first time throwing up since I stopped drinking 205 days (>6 months) ago. I used to throw up every week! I think it's amazing I haven't thrown up in so long - it's awful! So my triumph is my health. 

**Struggle:** I rehomed my pet snake on Saturday which was a really, really, really tough thing to do. I got her while drunk back in February of 2010. In the past few years I've been considering re-homing her, but I'd always get really upset and decide to keep her. Snakes don't recognise their owner or anything, so she won't get upset that  she's been rehomed the way a dog would or anything, and I haven't neglected her or anything, but I haven't given her the best home. The guy who I gave her to will give her an amazing home, and her life will be better but my heart just hurts.  I've been listening to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwHqWD1cXnk) a lot since. Anyway, I know that it was the right decision but it still hurts.

I'm still abrasive and aggressive, but I can bite my tongue longer and my communication skills are improving. 

**Struggle:** I'm battling a pretty heavy case of depression and self-loathing. I just got off the phone with someone who demanded I shower, change, walk my dogs, and call them so we can pick my next three tasks. It's pathetic. I'm un-medicated for the depression, but before you pick up the pitchforks there are two reasons why: 1.)

If I'm really wound up, a cycle ride or walk outside, perhaps with a podcast, will bring me back home in a much better, calmer mood.

Now, to be fair, I 'cheated' in the fact that my Number 1 reason for quitting was to get back into shape, so I had that as a goal before I even took the plunge into sobriety.

But that said, the gym is wonderful in a couple ways. First, it releases endorphines for that 'natural high' that a lot of people like. Now, I'm not saying to replace one addiction with another, but our bodies are *MADE* to move and perform physical activity, so it makes sense that nature rewards us for that.

The other thing about it is mental. It is a place to 'take a daily vacation' from the rest of your life. When I walk in the gym, I try to focus on my body, the reps I'm doing, etc, and let daily life wait outside. It's still all going to be there for me when I go back.

This change in mental state also breaks up the 'routine' of the day so it doesn't all blend together.

And I personally take it one step further with martial arts. I know I for one don't worry about my electric bill when someone is trying to punch me in the face."

I preferred these because you don't need a wine bottle opener for them and they don't make any sound when you crack them open. also, you could close them up with the twisty cap if someone was coming and stash them behind a pillow...

When I started hiding my drinking like this, I couldn't deny I had a problem for any longer. It's sad and scary to type out, but this step led me to re-evaluate my habits and stop.

Man, so many. I'd buy a double of a pack of beer or corked liter bottle, leave extra in car then Drink for a party/dinner and have more after everyone went to bed. Sometimes at party, to hide how much I actually drank.   
I'd stash empties in backyard spots before cleaning up when recycler went out.    
I'd hide vodka under furniture or in aquarium stand  spare tire wheel well of car and sometimes gun safe.     
I got so paranoid about bottles being found, I'd immediately pour into water bottle and toss the empty in public trash.  Leave ""water bottle"" in car which was just an awful place.

My ex-wife and I were terrible about leaving half empty water bottles around, so I replaced a few of them with Vodka. Behind a couch, behind the bed, etc. (She was legally blind so the chances of her finding any were incredibly small). She never found them but did catch me once.

Current situation had me either hiding them in the closet in my guest room and when my gf found that, I started keeping them in the trunk. I made it a habit of coming home, chugging 4-6 shots in the parking lot, and bee-lining it to the fridge as soon as I walked in the door to get a drink so when my gf came to hug or kiss me I would have already taken a sip of the drink so the alcohol smell would ""make sense"".

I bet it's drunk people that love you when you're drunk; just a guess though.  Personally now, I find most drunks, well, just fucking drunks.

It sounds like you're torn by social pressure.  But really, none of those people are going to give a shit as your health deteriorates and your organs start to fail.

Perhaps you haven't yet reached your ""rock bottom"" yet.  It will happen one day, it does to most of us.  And, just like karma, you won't get to choose what it is, it just sneaks up and bites you on the ass.

However, from what you've written, you seem way over the top on the hating part. The perception or idea of ""quiet, anti social guy"" is deeply rooted in your brain and you seem to only associate negative things with this. Instead, is it even possible to start replacing some of that negativity with more positive mental thoughts like ""I'm more contemplative than most. I like to be in my own private world. I'm not overly concerned with always chiming in on conversation and that's ok. It's nice to just be an observer"". Now, this is not trying to convince yourself that ""all"" is ok, but it's just about reframing your thoughts. Because honestly ""I hate being the quiet sober guy. People love me when I'm drunk"", those are just repetitive thoughts. Thoughts become beliefs and over time are ""reality"". Until I started becoming highly aware of my thoughts (partially through meditation and mindfulness), I didn't realize that they don't just magically happen TO you, we get to chose which we have and most important which we believe. 
On another note, it's quite important that you mention not feeling aligned wth your gender. Not sure you're ready to go down that path, but I'm sure at least subconsciously you feel more free to be yourself when you're drunk. That may or may not include certain aspects of that side of you coming out. I'd recommend exploring that either with a counselor, through literature or a community group. I wouldn't be surprised at all to learn you may be on that more quiet, antisocial side due to some deeper issues with self acceptance that alcohol temporarily either erases or helps you forget. 
GOOD LUCK on your journey to self discovery!! Best of luck doing that with a clear, sober and brave mind and body. "

Yes, there was a difficult adjustment period during which I felt less than normal by any standard, and drunkenness would have fixed that in a minute. But by waiting it out, I achieved a better baseline. 

Alcohol abuse for fixing social awkwardness can only work for so long. The longer I drank, the less attention I paid to personal development or noticing others, the wider the gap between me and ""normal"" I had to fill, until even getting too drunk to notice it didn't help anymore. The only way out for me was to face myself without alcohol and actually learn some coping skills I could remember. 

I relate to all the uncertainty in your post. Weight loss is a fine reason to give up alcohol for a time period. The stuff damages multiple physical systems in excess... all reasons for removing it are valid. 

Declaring a permanent change isn't necessary. Deciding to quit forever was too much for me so I didn't. Best of luck to you and I hope you keep reading and posting."

I definitely understand what you mean about the temptation and it being hard to fight early on. It's not easy to quit, in fact, in my experience, it was super fuckin' tough. Took me a few months of trying to string a day or two together before I finally *really* committed myself to making the change. SD and [the baby steps at this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) were instrumental to me in making that change early on. I never imposed that ultimate ""I'm never drinking again"" rule on myself, but I made the decision daily to not drink, for that day alone, and I had one ultimate goal. Get my ass to bed sober, whatever it takes. I started with that, and spent a LOT of my free time here on SD, just trying to learn more about what worked for others, what didn't, and worked to figure out my own plan for navigating the journey that is sobriety. 

I had a realization one day, that if I let booze into the fight, it's always gonna win. I put up a good fight for a long time, but at the end of the day, it was always winning, so I took it out of the equation. I had to face the fact that booze and me no longer went together. I didn't have to fight with myself any longer, I just let go of the notion that I could drink like a normal person. I can't, as proven by my horrible track record. After I realized that, my life got much easier to handle.

I know this wasn't your only reason, but it does point out your motivation. But there is a *huge* difference between motivation and discipline. Motivation gets you started, discipline gets you to the finish line.

No one can tell you exactly what to do, but I encourage you to look at your life and see if you need to make any adjustments to make your life change easier.

I've been in AA for a short amount of time - around three years - and from what I've noticed, age isn't really indicative of a lot in AA. What I've seen is that there are certain people who have a certain way about them, who exemplify the principals that the book talks about, and who speak a language I get. If there are any of those people in your meetings, you should by all means try to get them to sponsor you in working the steps. If not, keep going to meetings and keep listening. 

Like others have said, there's no reason not to do AA and get counseling, and post here, and whatever else you can think of to improve your chances. I certainly have, and I stick to it, because I'm still motivated. That's going to be key for you too, someday. Try not to forget this day 2, or you might need to relive it."

If you think it's somehow ""worse"" that you relapsed after 14 months then I would have to disagree.  The feeling of relapsing after 36 hours sucked a lot too. Then I relapsed again after 14 hours, that was awful again.  A relapse is a relapse, regardless of how much time came before.  So you can stop again, and now you learned that abstinence is only a cure for alcoholism whilst abstinent.

I stopped for almost two years at one point and after relapsing extremely hard for quite some time I did stop for right around ten months.  And then another short period after that.

It's been the most stressful point of my life, and that shame will cause you so much harm when you're drinking.  There's help.  People care about you.  Don't hide from them because of that shame.

I like to look at it as starting again as opposed to starting over.  Those 14 months are not lost, you earned them and they are yours to keep forever.  They are only a waste if you learned nothing from them.

Are you working any kind of program, and what will you do different this time?

I've found that relapses can be very insightful if we have the courage to look deep within our soul to try and uncover what makes us want to drink until blackout every night.  If we just say that I can't drink because the alcohol makes me do such and such, them we miss the opportunity for greater self awareness.

Thanks for stopping by with your story, it has helped me."
3v3ajn,cxkekwi,dchuey,2015-12-02 08:58:00,"Addiction will always try to persuade us that we're better, or cured, or that it was all in our heads.

For whatever reason, I recorded my semi-drunk self the night I decided to quit. Listening to those ten minutes of heartfelt shame, regret, sadness, and self-loathing is all it takes to remind me that I'll never be 'better' or fixed the way addiction would have me believe.

I had to choose: a happy life or.. what? Groundhog Day? Waking up hung over or still drunk each morning? Trying to remember what I did, who I was with, how I got home. Figuring out where my keys/phone/wallet/pants are (How did I lose my pants? I'll figure it out later). Wondering where this bruise or that cut came from. Hell, ine night I collapsed on a group of glass bottes. I landed so hard ear - first  on the mouth of one bottle that it crushed cartilage in my ear.  It's now difficult to clean with a q-tip and it's a constant reminder of the many near-miss warnings I ignored early on. I'm thankful that I never suffered a DUI or hurt anyone (Physically, that is. I hurt plenty of people with my selfishness along the way).

Since I've stopped I haven't woken up confused or disoriented. Overall, I'm in a better mood, although quick to anger. I eat candy now, which is new and unwanted. Aside from the candy, my only regrets are of my decisions (or habit of procrastination, rather) from before I quit. Now I'm owning up to and dealing with things one at a time. It's not easy. I'm working a ton of extra hours to keep a roof over my head and my power on, but that's only because I neglected so much chasing the bottom of a bottle that I pissed my emergency fund and savings away. I'll get back ahead im time so long as I stick to my guns.

Sorry for the rant. I've heard those familiar whispers before. I caught myself saying, 'I need a drink.' the other night and your post helps to remind me that I don't. I don't need a drink. In fact, nearly *anything* else is a better option. I hope you don't feel like I tried to take anything away from your post or derail the topic. Just trying to learn to ignore the inner demons and remind myself that this isn't a break for a day, a week, a month, 6 months, or a year. It's a decision to live my life instead of waking up in a hospital bed years down the road, wondering who these strange faces are above me and where my family is. Where the years have gone and what I have accomplished in my short time on this world. Fear of doing nothing and dying with that regret being the last thing I think about is my motivation.

Wish you the best. Stay strong."

3v33ki,cxk0bkx,randomquestion27,2015-12-01 21:55:23,"If you are sober just two weeks, it would be a bit irresponsible to diagnose you, just yet.  Only because withdrawal/post acute withdrawal takes at least a few weeks, and the mood swings you may have had during drinking, could have been caused from drinking, and now, they could be caused from post acute withdrawal.

You may have drank to alleviate symptoms, but it's a bit early to know if you have this; could be the substance use/withdrawal still."
3v33ki,cxjwuhp,OneLifeWasted,2015-12-01 20:22:19,bipolar is a complex issue with many extremes and many causes. I'm guessing you turn to alcohol to cope. That is a habit you can break if you can seek help for the above. IMO.

I am me, I will always be me, that I can't change. What me is, is what I can change. That takes time.

Five years ago I met my wife, I stopped smoking weed, I started working on my finances.

Three years ago we got married, I started trying to get better work.

Two years ago I started eating healthier.

A little over a year ago I stopped drinking.

This year I stopped smoking.

My life is slowly getting better, it is so hard, and some days I don't know how I will make it, but I never give up and I believe I will make it.

It doesn't matter to me if I do, it matters to me that I try.

I practice patience and compassion, for myself and others.

I hope you keep talking, to us or perhaps others. It's difficult, but it gets so much better. I couldn't have imagined my life today five years ago.

Sounds hokey, but have you tried practicing gratitude? You could start off writing down a couple things every day you're grateful for - food, a warm bed, people in your life. It sounds lame but it has had a profound impact on the way I see things.

3v2ttq,cxjut58,Luxbu,2015-12-01 19:28:51,"I'm feeling this. Except my girlfriend doesn't drink.

My GF and I dated (still do) through college and she graduated a semester early. We drank quite regularly on weekends, I just drank more. She graduated a semester earlier than I did (I switched majors) and that last semester of school I drank every night.

My earliest class was 10:30am, so it wasn't like I had anywhere to be. I was bored and alone at school. It wasn't uncommon to buy a fifth of whisky on a Friday and have it gone by Sunday night. I drank out of boredom, really. When she visited, I didn't drink, unless we went out together.

Then I graduated and came back to my parents and started my job search. I drank every night except for Friday and Saturday (ironically). My GF had a full time job and was more tired than anything so by the weekend, when we can only really see each other, we relaxed. I need to do that too. I mean, a six pack was/is easily finished in a night or a bottle of wine. Sometimes more than that. But I would be up till 2-3 in the morning and I needed to be up in the morning to make phone calls and find a job.

Fast forward a few months and I landed one. Nice! Your drinking will stop, I told myself. I was wrong. I've continued this habit since last year. It's progressively getting worse. I'm still drinking just as much and falling asleep at midnight (at the earliest) and waking up at 6:45 every morning. I'm tired as shit, but I pop some adderal (which I have been doing for 3 years) and my day is good to go.

There is almost nothing that is driving me to drink. I just love drinking. I almost always drink craft or micro brews, sometimes some cheap merlot, but I'm not doing it because my life is terrible. I realized I need to at least put down the hard liqour. I just keep drinking. Alot. 

Couple that with adderal and a terrible lack of sleep and I know that I'm setting myself up for failure. But I just can't stop. I drive past a liquor store every day and I pick up a six pack and I usually kill it when I get home. On nights I don't drink, I'm bored of out of my mind.

All of this is catching up to me now though. I feel like my boss and upper management is beginning to notice how tired I look. I'm not reckless or stupid when I drink, or during the day when I'm sober. I'm still doing a great job. I've missed work a couple of times because my alarm didn't go off, but I'm otherwise a pretty valuable employee. I'm just forgetful and spacious at times.

I just had the thought today that I heavily drink on such a regular basis that I don't think I can just stop without having some impact on my health from withdrawal."
3v2ttq,cxjv2yp,relThrowaway812,2015-12-01 19:36:05,"I completely understand. Generally a 750ml bottle of crown or vodka will last about 2-3 days for me. I can't drink beer because I don't feel anything at all. When I drink, I drink for a buzz. But once I have my buzz I want to keep it up, but end up over doing it every single time. 

When I have marijuana, I don't really have that problem, but it's incredibly rare for me to do that. 

My girlfriend almost never gets drunk, she'll have a beer or three and call it good. But I can't even begin to start ordering alcohol unless I know that it will result in at least a moderate buzz. And once I'm buzzed, I like to maintain that buzz until I go to bed. I'm fine when I'm sober, I'm happy, productive, etc. And if I know I need to drive or do something important, I can pass up the bottle and say no.

And, more importantly they massively taste like  arse. "
3v2rc0,cxjtunu,detox_ptsd,2015-12-01 19:03:09,"This question is brought up weekly (hell, daily?) and I've compiled a response based upon the discussions I've seen happen over time- if you want a deeper discussion on the matter, I urge you to use the ""Search"" feature and you'll find more threads dedicated to it than you could possibly hope for. In summary, there are essentially two main camps in /r/SD regarding ""non-alcoholic"" beer and wine. The first imbibes them and has varied success, including relapse and, conversely, no reported triggering nor ill effect. The second, MUCH larger, camp believes that non-alcoholic beer is for non-alcoholics.

I think the two major oppositions to these kind of beers are: 1) ""non-alcoholic"" does NOT mean ""alcohol-free""; many of these products (and kombucha, craft sodas, etc) contain up to 0.5% alcohol, where any amount of alcohol is ""too much"" for many of us who avoid alcohol entirely. 2) the intent behind drinking these beers is often complex and mired in old thinking patterns. 

If you've been around this subreddit for a while, you, no doubt, have seen several people make excuses for certain behaviors (like hanging out in unsafe social situations) which creates a slippery slope leading back to active addiction. Many of us believe that long-term sobriety necessitates a large shift in thinking and behavior; for many, this includes giving up anything that is similar to our old behaviors and beverages. Additionally, the outspoken drinking of ""non-alcoholic"" beverages *tends* to go hand-in-hand with ""special snowflake"" syndrome (""That might be the case for *those* people, but I'm pretty sure that *I'm* different""), which is generally a hallmark of relapse-waiting-to-happen.

Personally, I have yet to find any reason in sobriety to use ANY product that contains alcohol or is made to mimic alcoholic beverages. Your mileage may vary."

3v2llg,cxk1fn4,randomquestion27,2015-12-01 22:28:26,"On my first 'real' attempt, I made it and I'm still sober. Then again, I look back at all the failed attempts, and, at the time, I called them ""real"" and then later, decided ""J/k I was totes just playin'.""

My point is this:  Remember that this is a **real try**.  So, if you relapse - I'm not saying you will, no you will be good - but *if* you relapse, *remember* that you made a real try - and failed.  That should point out a couple of things to you:  1. that something has got to change, something went wrong and 2. you may need the help of others, if you give it a real try and it doesn't work.

Ok, I'm *not* saying this to discourage you or imply that you won't make it.

I am saying this because one of the reasons people relapse and relapse and relapse - like me, for example, myself:  I tried and failed and tried and failed and tried and failed and tried and failed and tried and failed and tried and failed - AND, after each time, for years and years, I *rewrote the story later.*  

Day 1: Here is my real try!

Day 2: Relapse

Day 3: Oh whatever it's not like I was really trying. 

Repeat 1,000 times. 

So, the rule to make with yourself right here and now is this:  DO NOT RE-WRITE YOUR PAST. There are no rewrites. Here is your real try. Pay attention, good luck and keep on truckin!

3v2llg,cxjtiyt,Jr518,2015-12-01 18:54:31,For me I only wish I was wise enough at 20 to be even having the thoughts about quitting that you are having.  I learned to drink in college and spent 20 more years perfecting the craft.  Don't waste the time I did.  Nothing good comes from it. 
3v2l0f,cxjtq13,socksynotgoogleable,2015-12-01 18:59:46,Most difficult thing you'll ever have to do in AA. Check it off. Congrats.

3v2l0f,cxjt55n,mare_nectaris_,2015-12-01 18:44:18,awesome! hoping to follow your lead soon.

3v2l0f,cxjwb1v,krimpus,2015-12-01 20:08:18,"I keep making excuses for why I can't go to meetings. I think it's because part of me, like you, really doesn't want to accept that I'm an alcoholic. This is pretty inspirational. Keep up the good work. I think tomorrow I'll just force myself to go into one. "
3v2l0f,cxjz29d,cyote1,2015-12-01 21:20:31,"When I first went to AA I thought it was going to be a bunch of old people or that they would be weird. I was sure I would just sit in the back and never talk to anyone. 

Cut to a year later, my sponsor has taken me through the big book and the steps, I go to a meeting every day because I want to, and I am able to sponsor other people now. 

The people in the rooms were infectious And a lot of them are my age. They're some of my best friends now.

AA helped me immensely. I would recommend trying it out and seeing what you think. "
3v2l0f,cxjx463,tvplease,2015-12-01 20:29:17,Once inside it really wasn't so bad.  It was just getting through that damn door.  Give it a go! 
3v2l0f,cxjx4br,sherritom,2015-12-01 20:29:24,Great job. You can do this. Ask for help and people will be there for you.

Look at what works for your schedule, but also the type of meeting. I find that some are much more helpful than others."

3v2l0f,cxkg4oh,larry_sellers_,2015-12-02 09:41:17,"That's great.  I went to as many meetings as possible during my first 3 months.  In the process, I made connections and friends that have helped me keep my sanity during early sobriety.  I'm really introverted, but once I became a regular at meetings, people started to walk up and introduce themselves. "
