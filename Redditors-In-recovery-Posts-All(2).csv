Something that has it all. If anyone knows of an amazing place that is reasonable $$ I do have good blue cross insurance.. I need some help. "
3n2u24,savethefairyland,2015-10-01 03:04:08,"I need your help, guys. I'm slipping.","Its nearly 1 AM where I am and I just need to get this out. Maybe by seeing it written down and asking for this subreddit's input I will be able to bring myself back to reality a bit :( And truthfully, I'm not even sure where to begin- or if this is the right place. Here goes.

My problem? Getting completely sh*tfaced, all the time, is starting to become a very, very attractive idea to me again. The cravings are back and they're gaining strength by the day. Its been a really rough couple of months (my marriage fell apart, I had to quit my job, trying to patch things back together, working out child custody arrangements...the list goes on) and I feel so weak to be even admitting it. 

I've already slipped up, twice. But those slips alone terrify me. The appeal in it to me, is that for even a few hours I feel like I am transformed into someone I don't hate. I'm not the scruffy, painfully shy shambling foreign weirdo with a bad stutter. I'm someone cool and glamorous and fun, who isn't a miserable wart on the faces of the pretty and not-friendless. The most insidious part of this illness is that it *insists that it is not a problem* even when YEARS of evidence to the contrary beg to differ. What makes it worse is that my ex-husband is also an addict: he's having so much fun drunk and high, while I am miserable and sober.

I don't even feel like I can call myself 'sober' anymore: I feel like I'd had a mission and I failed it. I am so disappointed in myself. I'm looking for more recovery meetings in my neck of the woods, and I am speaking to my therapist on Friday about it. The best I can do right now is physically not touch booze or anything else I fancy might take my problems away- or at least, any feelings I have about them.

Folks, please tell me, how do you cope when it just feels like its getting too strong? "
3n13tk,girlownsworld,2015-09-30 18:03:33,Compulsive Overeater - want to attend Open AA Meetings,"I'm a Compulsive Overeater, and there only happens to be 3 OA meetings in near-ish proximity to where I live, two of which happen to be on the same night. I wanted to check out an open AA meeting, but I am not an alcoholic.

When another addicted person goes to an AA meeting, do they sit and watch? Do they have to say ""I'm a gambling addict"" or a ""compulsive overeater""?

I'm not going for the same reasons an alcoholic would go-i.e. sponsorship/fellowship. Mostly it's to glean more about the readings (as it's a primarily BB meeting I want to go to), and maybe chat afterwards with people who experience the helplessness of addiction. 

Does anyone have experience going to open AA meetings with other addicted folks present?"
