Introduction to Our Members Share..........................................111


Beginnings
Reflections......................................................................................117
    The short passages that begin this section are excerpted from sto-
    ries in previous editions of the Basic Text.

I Found the Only NA Meeting in the World .............................121
    When he was using he went from one "mother" to another--from
    his mother's house to the military to marriage--until his wife
    tired of the insanity and found the only NA meeting in the world.
    In his story from our First Edition, this addict admits that it took
    him time but finally he learned to take action and be responsible
    for himself.

Mid-Pacific Serenity......................................................................128
    He lived in a place that many call paradise, but in his story from
    our First Edition, this beachcomber shares that for an addict, "skid
    row is in the mind." Through NA, he has found a sense of peace
    and a new way of life.

If You Want What We Have.........................................................135
    After a lifetime of using, this "southern gentleman" learned that
    the most gracious thing he could do was open the doors to an NA
    meeting. In this story from our First Edition, he recalls that the
    first time a man told him he loved him was in Narcotics Anony-
    mous.

Fearful Mother...............................................................................142
    In this story originally published in our Little White Book and
    added to the Basic Text at the Second Edition, a mother learns
    that she can come out of the paralyzing fear of addiction and turn
    her whole life around. She claims her seat as a woman in NA and
    hopes that one day more women will find recovery.

Jails, Institutions, and Recovery .................................................147
    This addict found freedom behind bars through the Fellowship of
    Narcotics Anonymous. This is a story from our First Edition.


                                             vi

I Was Different ..............................................................................151
   Not all addicts reach jails or institutions in order to hit their bot-
   tom. In his story, originally published in the Little White Book and
   later included in our Second Edition, this "different" addict ex-
   plains that his disease kept him confined to a life of fear and loneli-
   ness. He found serenity in a simple life in Narcotics Anonymous.


Coming Home
Reflections......................................................................................157
   These snapshots of our members' experiences finding NA are
   meant to be similar to the sharing at a topic meeting.

Start a Meeting, They Will Come ...............................................161
   He checked himself into treatment to avoid prison, but while
   he was there he found hope in the pages of a Basic Text. There was
   no NA in his part of rural Illinois, so he started a meeting and
   he's stayed clean through his own growing pains and those of the
   fellowship.

The Point.........................................................................................165
   This addict from the "wrong side" of Chicago's south side lost his
   best friend and his marriage to the disease of addiction. Recovery
   hasn't restored the things he's lost, but it has helped him make
   amends.

Carrying the Message ..................................................................171
   They used together and got clean together, but this addict got ac-
   tive in the program and his brother did not. This Saudi Arabian
   member found in the loss of his brother a powerful drive to carry
   the message.

Young Addict, Young NA Fellowship
Grow Up Together .......................................................................176
   She found NA when she was only fifteen. From her very first meet-
   ing, she knew NA was where she needed to be. Now, more than
   twenty years later, she's gone from a hostile, wasted teenager to a
   grateful member of the program.




                                              vii

A Quiet Satisfaction .....................................................................179
   At the end of his using even the other street boys and the dealers
   didn't want him around, but NA felt like home from his very first
   meeting. Sometimes he is the only person in the room, but that
   only renews this Kenyan addict's commitment to recovery.

The Only Requirement.................................................................184
   When he got to NA he was also in a drug-replacement program.
   He wanted what he saw in the rooms of Narcotics Anonymous,
   but was afraid of returning to his old life if he quit methadone.
   For ten months he went to meetings every day--and finally he
   got clean.

Restored to Dignity ......................................................................187
   She walked into NA--literally--and was treated with more love
   and respect than she ever had been. For this Mexican woman,
   a chance encounter on the beach opened the door to hope and
   freedom.

Second Chance .............................................................................192
   A host of bad choices ultimately led to relapse for this addict with
   thirteen years clean. It was a hard road back to recovery, but NA
   loved her until she could love herself.

Sowing the Seed ............................................................................198
   NA helped this Israeli addict rediscover his love of life. He had al-
   ways felt like an outsider before he got clean. Now he has a home
   group and understands fellowshipping to be a spiritual principle.

Sandwich .......................................................................................203
   A simple act of kindness showed this Dutch addict that he be-
   longed in Narcotics Anonymous. He worked through his fears that
   a relationship with God would be barred to him because he is gay
   and learned to trust the power of love.

The Spirit of Service......................................................................208
   This addict from Iran was "the most important person in the
   room" for two years before he got clean. Now he devotes himself to
   NA--sponsorship, the steps, and service.




                                           viii

A Brazilian Full of It! ....................................................................214
   As an entertainer she traveled the world, but found herself in the
   isolation of addiction wherever she went. This dancer found grace
   out of the spotlight, in the rooms of NA.

Another Chance to Live ...............................................................220
   When he reached the point where he couldn't live with or with-
   out drugs, this Australian addict attempted suicide. He survived
   through grace, and now he's been clean more than sixteen years.

At the End of the Road ................................................................224
   She thought she was a traveler, but it was really a need to escape
   herself. This addict from Norway found her way home on a Medi-
   terranean island.


Regardless of...
Reflections......................................................................................231
   These members share briefly about finding recovery in NA "re-
   gardless of age, race, sexual identity, creed, religion, or lack of
   religion."

Finally Connected ........................................................................235
   After a lifetime of feeling different, this lesbian addict found the
   key to connection in a common needs workshop.

One Third Step for Me,
One Giant Leap for My Recovery ..............................................240
   Addiction took him away from his Orthodox Jewish roots, but
   recovery helped him forge a new relationship with a God of his
   understanding.

Kia Ora Koutou ............................................................................245
   NA's message got through to this Maori addict. She got clean out
   of spite, but she stayed clean because of hope.

Growing Up in NA ......................................................................250
   When she got clean at sixteen in Chicago, she had no way of know-
   ing that more than twenty years later she would wind up in Italy,
   feeling how service connects us all.



                                             ix

A Serene Heart...............................................................................254
   At nine years clean, he was diagnosed with depression and schizo-
   phrenia, diseases he continues to treat with medication and thera-
   py. This addict learned that while mental illness is an outside issue
   in NA, dealing with it in his personal recovery is very much an
   inside issue for him.

From Gang Leader to Meeting Leader ......................................261
   As an African American gang member, he didn't think he had a
   future. But NA kept its promise, and now he has eight years clean
   and the life he always wanted.

Terminally Unique .......................................................................264
   Because she is HIV-positive, this transsexual addict was nearly
   denied surgery. Waiting helped her build a stronger relationship
   with a Higher Power.

A Textbook Case ...........................................................................270
   This Iroquois descendant ended up in an institution for "hard
   cases." When NA members brought a meeting in and shared, it
   was like seeing himself in the mirror for the first time.

Atheists Recover Too ...................................................................274
   The process of recovery and the spiritual principles of NA are a
   power greater than himself for this atheist addict.

Never Alone ..................................................................................278
   She got clean with her husband of twenty years, and eight years
   later nursed him through terminal cancer while both of her parents
   were terminally ill. Now, at sixty-one, she shares that the program
   can help any of us, regardless of age or circumstance.

Regardless of Age..........................................................................283
   The youngest person in the room, this addict still felt a connection
   right away and over time came to realize that recovery from addic-
   tion is a bond that transcends age.

Academic Addict ..........................................................................286
   As a PhD student in pharmacology, his knowledge of drugs almost
   killed him. Now he is a professor with more than twenty years
   clean and an understanding that recovery is not a science.



                                           x

What Makes Me Happy Now ....................................................292
   When NA first started in Japan, even members didn't believe a
   normal life could be possible for addicts, and especially women, in
   recovery. As the fellowship matured, this member and others like
   her came to realize "there is no model of the recovering addict."

I Was Unique .................................................................................298
   When he was new in the program, he learned that, despite his pro-
   fessional background and education, he belonged in NA. He had
   stayed clean since his story was published in our First Edition and
   revised it himself for this edition. Sadly, he did not live to see its
   publication.


Life on Life's Terms
Reflections......................................................................................305
   Members take turns reflecting here on their experiences living life
   on life's terms.

Life and Death in NA ...................................................................309
   When this addict lost a brother and a son to the disease of addic-
   tion, his heart was crushed and his faith was challenged. Going
   to meetings and working the steps have helped him to survive so
   much loss.

Breath of Life .................................................................................315
   Even in a remote corner of paradise, the disease can find us--and
   so can recovery. She kept coming back, and found freedom through
   fearless inventory work.

Just Say Yes.....................................................................................320
   This Indian addict believes "there are no bad days, only good days
   and learning days," and he has learned a lot in recovery. Perhaps
   most importantly, he has learned how to love and to trust the
   process.

Inside Job .......................................................................................327
   When she had years clean, depression almost killed this recovering
   addict. But a renewed commitment to recovery brought relief and
   a deeper relationship with her Higher Power.



                                              xi

God Walked In ..............................................................................330
    Among the challenges this addict has faced in his thirty years
    clean are cancer and open-heart surgery. From it all, he has
    learned about surrender and love.

One Potato ....................................................................................335
    Writing her story from a hospice, this HIV-positive lesbian tells
    how she survived great adversity to find grace in some unlikely
    places.

Mosaic.............................................................................................341
    Neither the military nor prison nor hospitalization helped
    this Russian addict clean up until some members brought a
    meeting--and a Basic Text--to the hospital. Reading the book
    gave him the willingness to try the NA way. Now he's been clean
    and working the steps for five years.

Family Disease, Family Recovery ..............................................348
    As a parent, sometimes recovery means accepting your children's
    disease as well. This woman helped her sons find their way home.

Enough ...........................................................................................352
    This Canadian addict had years clean before he was willing to face
    his addictive behavior in recovery. He now knows he doesn't have
    to talk clean and live dirty anymore.

It Is Worth It...................................................................................356
    He enlisted in the navy to avoid a second jail term, but kept us-
    ing until he finally hit a bottom. He got clean when NA was new
    in Colombia, and twenty years later, he and the fellowship have
    grown up together.

Becoming Whole ..........................................................................361
    Addiction is not the only disease this member has had to deal with.
    Diagnosed with schizophrenia, she has journeyed in recovery from
    suicidal patient to mental health counselor.

The Good We Do ..........................................................................365
    A string of "coincidences" led this addict to find a sponsor and to
    see that our acts of service can have far-reaching effects.




                                               xii

Sacred Places Inside .....................................................................368
   She was one of the first women in Iran NA when she got clean.
   Five years later, the fellowship had grown, but she had drifted
   away from the program. When her husband died, she relapsed.
   Now, clean again, she has true peace and self-respect.

I'm So Grateful that God Still Hears an Addict's Prayer ........373
   Recovery has allowed this inner-city addict to get an education
   and a rewarding career. Through giving back, he found that his
   relationship with his community and his God are the keys to real
   success.

Speaking Up ..................................................................................378
   This member from Ireland grew up quiet and withdrawn, but re-
   covery helped him overcome his fear of speaking in public to find
   his voice and himself.

NA Is a Road Map.........................................................................384
   This Portuguese addict was planning to abandon his young
   daughter and go buy drugs when a group of NA members invited
   him to a meeting. Now his daughter is grown and sees what NA
   has taught him about intimacy, respect, and love.

The Gratitude Side of Circumstance .........................................391
   His recovery journey brought him from a job as a pharmacist to
   one working alongside recovering addicts and has given him the
   tools to deal with life's challenges--illness, grief, and intimacy.

Our Symbol

Simplicity    is the key to our symbol; it imitates the simplicity of
our Fellowship. All sorts of occult and esoteric connotations can
be found in its simple outlines, but foremost in the minds of the
Fellowship are easily understood meanings and relationships.
  The outer circle denotes a universal and total program that has
room within it for all manifestations of the recovering person.
  The square, whose lines are defined, is easily seen and un-
derstood, but there are other unseen parts of the symbol. The
square base denotes Good will, the ground of both the Fellow-
ship and the members of our society. Good will is best exempli-
fied in service; proper service is "Doing the right thing for the
right reason." When Good will supports and motivates both the
individual and the Fellowship, we are fully whole and wholly
free. Probably the last to be lost to freedom will be the stigma of
being an addict.
  It is the four pyramid sides that rise from the base in a three-
dimensional figure that represent Self, Society, Service, and God.
All rise to the point of Freedom. All parts are closely related to
the needs and aims of the addict who is seeking recovery, and to
the purpose of the Fellowship which is to make recovery avail-
able to all. The greater the base, (as we grow in unity in numbers
and in fellowship) the broader the sides of the pyramid, and the
higher the point of freedom.

Preface to the Sixth Edition

Many     of us have never known recovery without the Basic Text.
Our meetings open with readings found in its pages; it sits on
the literature tables in our groups; and the book itself has been
a constant in our recovery through the months or years or de-
cades. Since the first edition of Narcotics Anonymous, our Basic
Text, was published, NA has grown and changed in countless
ways. In many respects, the Basic Text has been instrumental in
that evolution. There are more than 43,900 weekly NA meetings
today; in 1982, the year the World Service Conference approved
the Basic Text, there were about 2,700. Most places in the world
did not offer an NA meeting every night of the week. In fact,
most places didn't offer a meeting any night of the week. Now
NAis in 130 countries and we speak 65 languages. The Basic Text
itself is translated into eighteen languages.      1

   Certainly NA's growth cannot be attributed to the power of
this book alone. But the fact is the Basic Text is one of the most
effective means we have of carrying the message. Where it is
published and distributed, NAgrows, not just in numbers but in
breadth of recovery and experience. As our members stay clean
ten, twenty, thirty years and more, our fellowship has more and
more experience dealing with challenges beyond "not picking up
the first drug." In the Sixth Edition, you will read stories of ad-
dicts who stayed clean through the loss of loved ones, serious ill-
nesses, raising children, marriage, divorce, getting an education,
pursuing careers, and much more. The common thread through
all of these varied experiences is that we draw strength from the

     NAprogram regardless of how long we have been clean or what
     life situation we are facing. Over the decades our members have
     lived a lot of life on life's terms and have learned a lot about what
     it means to recover from addiction in that context.
        Now, with the publication of our Sixth Edition Basic Text, we
     can say NA has, in many respects, come of age. That process has
     not been without growing pains, however. From 1983 to 1988, we
     published five editions and a revision of the Basic Text. For years
     afterward, the fellowship as a whole was unwilling to under-
     take another revision. Many of us thought we would never see
     the day that a new edition of the Basic Text could be welcomed
     by the fellowship. And so, the publication of a Sixth Edition is
     something to celebrate and a real marker of our ability, as a fel-
     lowship, to grow and change.
        Chapters One through Ten remain as they were in the Fifth
     Edition. These ten chapters speak to many of us in a way that no
     other literature does, in a voice that is difficult, if not impossible,
     to duplicate. What is significantly different in the Sixth Edition
     text, however, in addition to this new preface, is the personal ex-
     perience that follows Chapters One through Ten.
        It would be impossible to list all of the ways in which the face
     of NA has changed over the years, and this new edition doesn't
     pretend to be a mirror, reflecting back a perfect image of our
     membership. But it does aim to represent the richness of our dif-
     ferences as well as it can. The Basic Text already tells us that any
     addict is welcome in NA regardless of what we look like, how
     old we are, and what kind of spiritual beliefs we hold. Addic-
     tion is a disease that does not discriminate, and neither does the
     program of NA. Admittedly there is a stereotype of the "typi-
     cal" candidate for NA--urban, criminal, a needle-user--and
     that narrow vision does describe some of us, but we are also
     professionals, and parents, and students, and so on, living in cit-
     ies, small towns, and rural communities in countries all over the
     world. We can only hope to gesture at our diversity in the space

of one book. Even our name itself, Narcotics Anonymous, may
not fully describe our membership. Addiction has nothing to do
with where we come from or the specific substances we used.
  Our members come from every walk of life. We are not con-
tained within political or geographic boundaries, nor are we
limited by any individual differences in faith or philosophy. No
matter what conflicts are unfolding in the world at large, we as-
pire to an ideal of unity: Our common welfare should come first.
Our text explains that this unity of purpose helps us "to achieve
the true spirit of anonymity" where all of us are equal as mem-
bers of the group. With that as our foundation, we as individual
recovering addicts are each able to find our own distinct voice
and to sing a song that is uniquely ours. This new edition pre-
sents some of those voices.
  We hope the Sixth Edition Basic Text will offer a vision of re-
covery for addicts around the world--those who have already
found the rooms of NA and those who will walk through our
doors tomorrow. Over the years our fellowship has changed and
our literature has expanded and been revised, but the message
remains the same: An addict, any addict, can stop using drugs,
lose the desire to use, and find a new way to live. You are wel-
come here. Please stay and be part of our growth, change, and
recovery.


Preface to the First Edition

   "The full fruit of a labor of love lives in the harvest, and that
   always comes in its right season..."

The   material for this book was drawn from the personal experi-
ences of addicts within the Fellowship of Narcotics Anonymous.
This Basic Text is based on an outline derived from our "white
book," Narcotics Anonymous. The first eight chapters are based
on the topic headings in the white book and carry the same title.
A ninth chapter has been included, Just for Today, as well as a
tenth chapter, More Will Be Revealed. Following is a brief his-
tory of the book.
   Narcotics Anonymous was formed in July 1953, with the first
meeting held in Southern California. The Fellowship grew er-
ratically but quickly spread to various parts of the United States.
From the beginning, the need was evident for a book on recov-
ery to help strengthen the Fellowship. The white book, Narcotics
Anonymous, was published in 1962.
   The Fellowship still had little structure, however, and the
1960s were a period of struggle. Membership grew rapidly for
a time and then began to decline. The need for more specific
direction was readily apparent. NA demonstrated its maturity
in 1972, when a World Service Office (WSO) was opened in Los
Angeles. The WSO has brought the needed unity and sense of
purpose to the Fellowship.
   The opening of the WSO brought stability to the growth of the
Fellowship. Today, there are recovering addicts in thousands of
meetings all across the United States and in many foreign coun-
tries. Today the World Service Office truly serves a worldwide
Fellowship.

       Narcotics Anonymous has long recognized the need for a
     complete Basic Text on addiction--a book about addicts, by ad-
     dicts and for addicts.
       This effort was strengthened, after the formation of WSO, with
     the publication of The NA Tree, a pamphlet on service work. This
     pamphlet was the original service manual of the Fellowship. It
     has been followed by subsequent and more comprehensive vol-
     umes, and now the NA Service Manual.
       The manual outlined a service structure that included a World
     Service Conference (WSC). The WSC, in turn, included a Litera-
     ture Committee. With the encouragement of WSO, several mem-
     bers of the Board of Trustees, and the Conference, work began.
       As the cry for literature, particularly a comprehensive text,
     became more widespread, the WSC Literature Committee de-
     veloped. In October 1979, the first World Literature Conference
     was held in Wichita, Kansas, followed by conferences in Lincoln,
     Nebraska; Memphis, Tennessee; Santa Monica, California; War-
     ren, Ohio; and Miami, Florida.
       The WSC Literature Subcommittee, working in conference
     and as individuals, has collected hundreds of pages of mate-
     rial from members and groups throughout the Fellowship. This
     material has been laboriously catalogued, edited, assembled,
     dismembered and reassembled. Dozens of area and regional
     representatives working with the Literature Committee have
     dedicated thousands of man-hours to produce the work pre-
     sented here. But more importantly, those members have consci-
     entiously sought to ensure a "group conscience" text.
       In keeping with the spirit of anonymity, we, the WSC Lit-
     erature Subcommittee, feel it appropriate to express our special
     gratitude and appreciation to the Fellowship as a whole, espe-
     cially the many who contributed material for inclusion in the
     book. We feel that this book is a synthesis of the collective group
     conscience of the Fellowship and that every single idea submit-
     ted is included in the work in some form or another.

  This volume is intended as a textbook for every addict seek-
ing recovery. As addicts, we know the pain of addiction, but we
also know the joy of recovery we have found in the Fellowship
of Narcotics Anonymous. We believe the time has come to share
our recovery, in written form, with all who desire what we have
found. Appropriately, this book is devoted to informing every
addict:

  just for today, you never have to use again!

Therefore,
  With gratitude in our recovery, we dedicate our NA book to
the loving service of our Higher Power. That through the devel-
opment of a conscious contact with God, no addict seeking re-
covery need die without a chance to find a better way of life.
  We remain trusted servants in gratitude and loving service,

We cannot change the nature of the addict or addiction.

We can help to change the old lie "Once an addict, always

an addict," by striving to make recovery more available.

God, help us to remember this difference.

Introduction

This   book is the shared experience of the Fellowship of Narcot-
ics Anonymous. We welcome you to read this text, hoping that
you will choose to share with us the new life that we have found.
We have by no means found a cure for addiction. We offer only
a proven plan for daily recovery.
   In NA, we follow a program adapted from Alcoholics Anony-
mous. More than one million people have recovered in A.A.,
most of them just as hopelessly addicted to alcohol as we were
to drugs. We are grateful to the A.A. Fellowship for showing us
the way to a new life.
   The Twelve Steps of Narcotics Anonymous, as adapted from
A.A., are the basis of our recovery program. We have only broad-
ened their perspective. We follow the same path with a single ex-
ception; our identification as addicts is all-inclusive with respect
to any mood-changing, mind-altering substance. Alcoholism is
too limited a term for us; our problem is not a specific substance,
it is a disease called addiction. We believe that as a fellowship,
we have been guided by a Greater Consciousness, and are grate-
ful for the direction that has enabled us to build upon a proven
program of recovery.
   We come to Narcotics Anonymous by various means and be-
lieve that our common denominator is that we failed to come to
terms with our addiction. Because of the variety of addicts found
within our Fellowship, we approach the solution contained
within this book in general terms. We pray that we have been
searching and thorough, so that every addict who reads this vol-
ume will find the hope that we have found.

      Based on our experience, we believe that every addict,
    including the potential addict, suffers from an incurable disease
    of body, mind, and spirit. We were in the grip of a hopeless di-
    lemma, the solution of which is spiritual in nature. Therefore,
    this book will deal with spiritual matters.
      We are not a religious organization. Our program is a set of
    spiritual principles through which we are recovering from a
    seemingly hopeless state of mind and body. Throughout the
    compiling of this work, we have prayed:

      "GOD, grant us knowledge that we may write according to
      Your Divine precepts. Instill in us a sense of Your purpose. Make
      us servants of Your will and grant us a bond of selflessness, that
      this may truly be Your work, not ours--in order that no addict,
      anywhere, need die from the horrors of addiction."

    Everything    that occurs in the course of NA service must be
    motivated by the desire to more successfully carry the message
    of recovery to the addict who still suffers. It was for this reason
    that we began this work. We must always remember that as indi-
    vidual members, groups and service committees, we are not and
    should never be in competition with each other. We work sepa-
    rately and together to help the newcomer and for our common
    good. We have learned, painfully, that internal strife cripples our
    Fellowship; it prevents us from providing the services necessary
    for growth.
      It is our hope that this book will help the suffering addict find
    the solution that we have found. Our purpose is to remain clean,
    just for today, and to carry the message of recovery.

Many books have been written about the nature
of addiction. This book primarily concerns itself
with the nature of recovery. If you are an addict
and have found this book, please give yourself
a break and read it!


                           Chapter One



Who Is an Addict?

   Most of us do not have to think twice about this question.
   we know! Our whole life and thinking was centered in drugs
   in one form or another--the getting and using and finding
   ways and means to get more. We lived to use and used to
   live. Very simply, an addict is a man or woman whose life is
   controlled by drugs. We are people in the grip of a continuing
   and progressive illness whose ends are always the same: jails,
   institutions and death.

Those    of us who have found the Program of Narcotics Anony-
mous do not have to think twice about the question: Who is an
addict? We know! The following is our experience.
   As addicts, we are people whose use of any mind-altering,
mood-changing substance causes a problem in any area of life.
Addiction is a disease that involves more than the use of drugs.
Some of us believe that our disease was present long before the
first time we used.
   Most of us did not consider ourselves addicted before coming
to the Narcotics Anonymous Program. The information avail-
able to us came from misinformed people. As long as we could
stop using for a while, we thought we were all right. We looked
at the stopping, not the using. As our addiction progressed, we
thought of stopping less and less. Only in desperation did we
ask ourselves, "Could it be the drugs?"
   We did not choose to become addicts. We suffer from a disease
that expresses itself in ways that are anti-social and that makes
detection, diagnosis and treatment difficult.




                                     3

4 Narcotics Anonymous


     Our disease isolated us from people except when we were
  getting, using and finding ways and means to get more. Hos-
  tile, resentful, self-centered and self-seeking, we cut ourselves
  off from the outside world. Anything not completely familiar
  became alien and dangerous. Our world shrank and isolation
  became our life. We used in order to survive. It was the only way
  of life that we knew.
     Some of us used, misused and abused drugs and still did not
  consider ourselves addicts. Through all of this, we kept telling
  ourselves, "I can handle it." Our misconceptions about the na-
  ture of addiction included visions of violence, street crime, dirty
  needles and jail.
     When our addiction was treated as a crime or moral defi-
  ciency, we became rebellious and were driven deeper into isola-
  tion. Some of the highs felt great, but eventually the things that
  we had to do to continue using reflected desperation. We were
  caught in the grip of our disease. We were forced to survive any
  way that we could. We manipulated people and tried to control
  everything around us. We lied, stole, cheated and sold ourselves.
  We had to have drugs regardless of the cost. Failure and fear be-
  gan to invade our lives.
     One aspect of our addiction was our inability to deal with life
  on life's terms. We tried drugs and combinations of drugs to cope
  with a seemingly hostile world. We dreamed of finding a magic
  formula that would solve our ultimate problem--ourselves.
  The fact was that we could not use any mind-altering or mood-
  changing substance, including marijuana and alcohol, success-
  fully. Drugs ceased to make us feel good.
     At times, we were defensive about our addiction and justified
  our right to use, especially when we had legal prescriptions. We
  were proud of the sometimes illegal and often bizarre behavior
  that typified our using. We "forgot" about the times when we
  sat alone and were consumed by fear and self-pity. We fell into
  a pattern of selective thinking. We only remembered the good

                                                  Who Is an Addict? 5


drug experiences. We justified and rationalized the things that
we did to keep from being sick or going crazy. We ignored the
times when life seemed to be a nightmare. We avoided the real-
ity of our addiction.
   Higher mental and emotional functions, such as conscience
and the ability to love, were sharply affected by our use of drugs.
Living skills were reduced to the animal level. Our spirit was
broken. The capacity to feel human was lost. This seems extreme,
but many of us have been in this state of mind.
   We were constantly searching for the answer--that person,
place or thing that would make everything all right. We lacked
the ability to cope with daily living.As our addiction progressed,
many of us found ourselves in and out of institutions.
   These experiences indicated that there was something wrong
with our lives. We wanted an easy way out. Some of us thought of
suicide. Our attempts were usually feeble and only helped to con-
tribute to our feelings of worthlessness. We were trapped in the
illusion of "what if," "if only" and "just one more time." When
we did seek help, we were only looking for the absence of pain.
   We had regained good physical health many times, only to
lose it by using again. Our track record shows that it is impossi-
ble for us to use successfully. No matter how well we may appear
to be in control, using drugs always brings us to our knees.
   Like other incurable diseases, addiction can be arrested. We
agree that there is nothing shameful about being an addict, pro-
vided we accept our dilemma honestly and take positive action.
We are willing to admit without reservation that we are allergic
to drugs. Common sense tells us that it would be insane to go
back to the source of our allergy. Our experience indicates that
medicine cannot cure our illness.
   Although physical and mental tolerance play a role, many
drugs require no extended period of use to trigger allergic reac-
tions. Our reaction to drugs is what makes us addicts, not how
much we use.

6 Narcotics Anonymous


    Many of us did not think that we had a problem with drugs
  until the drugs ran out. Even when others told us that we had a
  problem, we were convinced that we were right and the world
  was wrong. We used this belief to justify our self-destructive be-
  havior. We developed a point of view that enabled us to pursue
  our addiction without concern for our own well-being or the
  well-being of others. We began to feel that the drugs were killing
  us long before we could ever admit it to anyone else. We noticed
  that if we tried to stop using, we couldn't. We suspected that we
  had lost control over the drugs and had no power to stop.
    Certain things followed as we continued to use. We became
  accustomed to a state of mind that is common to addicts. We
  forgot what it was like before we started using; we forgot about
  social graces. We acquired strange habits and mannerisms. We
  forgot how to work; we forgot how to play; we forgot how to ex-
  press ourselves and how to show concern for others. We forgot
  how to feel.
    While using, we lived in another world. We experienced only
  periodic jolts of reality or self-awareness. It seemed that we were
  at least two people instead of one, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. We
  ran around and tried to get our lives together before our next
  run. Sometimes we could do this very well, but later, it was less
  important and more impossible. In the end, Dr. Jekyll died and
  Mr. Hyde took over.
    Each of us has a few things that we never did. We cannot let
  these things become excuses to use again. Some of us feel lonely
  because of differences between us and other members. This feel-
  ing makes it difficult to give up old connections and old habits.
    We all have different tolerances for pain. Some addicts needed
  to go to greater extremes than others. Some of us found that we
  had enough when we realized that we were getting high too of-
  ten and it was affecting our daily lives.
    At first, we were using in a manner that seemed to be social
  or at least controllable. We had little indication of the disaster

                                                  Who Is an Addict? 7


that the future held for us. At some point, our using became
uncontrollable and anti-social. This began when things were
going well, and we were in situations that allowed us to use
frequently. This was usually the end of the good times. We may
have tried to moderate, substitute or even stop using, but we
went from a state of drugged success and well-being to complete
spiritual, mental and emotional bankruptcy. This rate of decline
varies from addict to addict. Whether it occurs in years or days,
it is all downhill. Those of us who don't die from the disease will
go on to prison, mental institutions or complete demoralization
as the disease progresses.
   Drugs had given us the feeling that we could handle whatever
situation might develop. We became aware, however, that drug
usage was largely responsible for some of our worst predica-
ments. Some of us may spend the rest of our lives in jail for a
drug-related crime.
   We had to reach our bottom, before we were willing to stop.
We were finally motivated to seek help in the latter stage of our
addiction. Then it was easier for us to see the destruction, disas-
ter and delusion of our using. It was harder to deny our addic-
tion when problems were staring us in the face.
   Some of us first saw the effects of addiction on the people clos-
est to us. We were very dependent on them to carry us through
life. We felt angry, disappointed and hurt when they found other
interests, friends and loved ones. We regretted the past, dreaded
the future, and we weren't too thrilled about the present. After
years of searching, we were more unhappy and less satisfied
than when it all began.
   Our addiction enslaved us. We were prisoners of our own
mind and were condemned by our own guilt. We gave up the
hope that we would ever stop using drugs. Our attempts to stay
clean always failed, causing us pain and misery.
   As addicts, we have an incurable disease called addiction.
The disease is chronic, progressive and fatal. However, it is a

8 Narcotics Anonymous


  treatable disease. We feel that each individual has to answer the
  question, "Am I an addict?" How we got the disease is of no im-
  mediate importance to us. We are concerned with recovery.
     We begin to treat our addiction by not using. Many of us
  sought answers but failed to find any workable solution until
  we found each other. Once we identify ourselves as addicts, help
  becomes possible. We can see a little of ourselves in every addict
  and see a little of them in us. This insight lets us help one another.
  Our future seemed hopeless until we found clean addicts who
  were willing to share with us. Denial of our addiction kept us
  sick, but our honest admission of addiction enabled us to stop
  using. The people of Narcotics Anonymous told us that they
  were recovering addicts who had learned to live without drugs.
  If they could do it, so could we.
     The only alternatives to recovery are jails, institutions,
  dereliction and death. Unfortunately, our disease makes us deny
  our addiction. If you are an addict, you can find a new way of
  life through the NA Program. We have become very grateful
  in the course of our recovery. Through abstinence and through
  working the Twelve Steps of Narcotics Anonymous, our lives
  have become useful.
     We realize that we are never cured, and that we carry the
  disease within us for the rest of our lives. We have a disease, but
  we do recover. Each day we are given another chance. We are
  convinced that there is only one way for us to live, and that is
  the NA way.

What Is the
Narcotics Anonymous Program?

NA is a nonprofit Fellowship or society of men and women for
whom drugs had become a major problem. We are recovering
addicts who meet regularly to help each other stay clean. This is
a program of complete abstinence from all drugs. There is only
one requirement for membership, the desire to stop using. We
suggest that you keep an open mind and give yourself a break.
Our program is a set of principles written so simply that we can
follow them in our daily lives. The most important thing about
them is that they work.
   There are no strings attached to NA. We are not affiliated
with any other organizations, we have no initiation fees or
dues, no pledges to sign, no promises to make to anyone. We are
not connected with any political, religious or law enforcement
groups, and are under no surveillance at any time. Anyone may
join us, regardless of age, race, sexual identity, creed, religion or
lack of religion.
   We are not interested in what or how much you used or who
your connections were, what you have done in the past, how
much or how little you have, but only in what you want to do
about your problem and how we can help. The newcomer is the
most important person at any meeting, because we can only
keep what we have by giving it away. We have learned from our
group experience that those who keep coming to our meetings
regularly stay clean.

   Narcotics  Anonymous is a Fellowship of men and women who
  are learning to live without drugs. We are a nonprofit society
  and have no dues or fees of any kind. Each of us has paid the
  price of membership. We have paid for the right to recover with
  our pain.
     Surviving against all odds, we are addicts who meet regu-
  larly. We respond to honest sharing and listen to the stories of
  our members for the message of recovery. We realize that there
  is hope for us at last.
     We make use of the tools that have worked for other recover-
  ing addicts who have learned in NA to live without drugs. The
  Twelve Steps are positive tools that make our recovery possible.
  Our primary purpose is to stay clean and to carry the message to
  the addict who still suffers. We are united by our common prob-
  lem of addiction. By meeting, talking, and helping other addicts,
  we are able to stay clean. The newcomer is the most important
  person at any meeting, because we can only keep what we have
  by giving it away.
     Narcotics Anonymous has many years of experience with
  literally hundreds of thousands of addicts. This firsthand ex-
  perience in all phases of illness and recovery is of unparalleled,
  therapeutic value. We are here to share freely with any addict
  who wants to recover.
     Our message of recovery is based on our experience. Before
  coming to the Fellowship, we exhausted ourselves by trying to
  use successfully, and wondering what was wrong with us. After
  coming to NA, we found ourselves among a very special group
  of people who have suffered like us and found recovery. In their
  experiences, freely shared, we found hope for ourselves. If the
  program worked for them, it would work for us.
     The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop using.
  We have seen the program work for any addict who honestly
  and sincerely wants to stop. We don't have to be clean when we
  get here, but after the first meeting, we suggest that newcomers

                          What Is the Narcotics Anonymous Program? 11


keep coming back and come back clean. We don't have to wait
for an overdose or a jail sentence, to get help from Narcotics
Anonymous. Addiction is not a hopeless condition from which
there is no recovery.
  We meet addicts like ourselves who are clean. We watch, listen
and realize that they have found a way to live and enjoy life with-
out drugs. We don't have to settle for the limitations of the past.
We can examine and re-examine our old ideas. We can constantly
improve our old ideas or replace them with new ones. We are
men and women who have discovered and admitted that we are
powerless over our addiction. When we use, we lose.
  When we discovered that we could not live with or without
drugs, we sought help through NA, rather than prolong our suf-
fering. The program works a miracle in our lives. We become
different people. Working the steps and maintaining abstinence
give us a daily reprieve from our self-imposed life sentences. We
become free to live.
  We want our place of recovery to be a safe place, free from out-
side influences. For the protection of the Fellowship, we insist
that no drugs or paraphernalia be brought to any meeting.
  We feel totally free to express ourselves within the Fellow-
ship, because law enforcement agencies are not involved. Our
meetings have an atmosphere of empathy. In accordance with
the principles of recovery, we try not to judge, stereotype or
moralize with each other. We are not recruited and membership
does not cost anything. NAdoes not provide counseling or social
services.
  Our meetings are a process of identification, hope and shar-
ing. The heart of NAbeats when two addicts share their recovery.
What we do becomes real for us when we share it. This happens
on a larger scale in our regular meetings. A meeting happens
when two or more addicts gather to help each other stay clean.
  At the beginning of the meeting, we read NA literature that
is available to anyone. Some meetings have speakers, topic

12 Narcotics Anonymous


   discussions or both. Closed meetings are for addicts or those
   who think they might have a drug problem. Open meetings
   welcome anyone wishing to experience our fellowship. The at-
   mosphere of recovery is protected by our Twelve Traditions. We
   are fully self-supporting through voluntary contributions from
   our members. Regardless of where the meeting takes place, we
   remain unaffiliated. Meetings provide a place to be with fellow
   addicts.All we need are two addicts, caring and sharing, to make
   a meeting.
      We let new ideas flow into us. We ask questions. We share
   what we have learned about living without drugs. Though the
   principles of the Twelve Steps may seem strange to us at first, the
   most important thing about them is that they work. Our program
   is a way of life. We learn the value of spiritual principles such as
   surrender, humility and service from reading the NA literature,
   going to meetings and working the steps. We find that our lives
   steadily improve, if we maintain abstinence from mind-altering,
   mood-changing chemicals and work the Twelve Steps to sustain
   our recovery. Living this program gives us a relationship with
   a Power greater than ourselves, corrects defects and leads us to
   help others. Where there has been wrong, the program teaches
   us the spirit of forgiveness.
      Many books have been written about the nature of addiction.
   This book concerns itself with the nature of recovery. If you are
   an addict and have found this book, please give yourself a break
   and read it.

Why Are We Here?

  Before coming to the Fellowship of NA, we could not manage
  our own lives. We could not live and enjoy life as other people
  do. We had to have something different and we thought we had
  found it in drugs. We placed their use ahead of the welfare of
  our families, our wives, husbands, and our children. We had
  to have drugs at all costs. We did many people great harm, but
  most of all we harmed ourselves. Through our inability to accept
  personal responsibilities we were actually creating our own
  problems. We seemed to be incapable of facing life on its own
  terms.
     Most of us realized that in our addiction we were slowly
  committing suicide, but addiction is such a cunning enemy of
  life that we had lost the power to do anything about it. Many of
  us ended up in jail, or sought help through medicine, religion
  and psychiatry. None of these methods was sufficient for us.
  Our disease always resurfaced or continued to progress until
  in desperation, we sought help from each other in Narcotics
  Anonymous.
     After coming to NA we realized we were sick people. We
  suffered from a disease from which there is no known cure. It
  can, however, be arrested at some point, and recovery is then
  possible.

We    are addicts seeking recovery. We used drugs to cover our
feelings, and did whatever was necessary to get drugs. Many
of us woke up sick, unable to make it to work or went to work
loaded. Many of us stole to support our habit. We hurt the ones
we loved. We did all these things and told ourselves, "I can



                                   13

14 Narcotics Anonymous


   handle it." We were looking for a way out. We couldn't face life
   on life's terms. In the beginning, using was fun. For us using
   became a habit and finally was necessary for survival. The pro-
   gression of the disease was not apparent to us. We continued
   on the path of destruction, unaware of where it was leading us.
   We were addicts and did not know it. Through drugs, we tried
   to avoid reality, pain and misery. When the drugs wore off, we
   realized that we still had the same problems, and they were be-
   coming worse. We sought relief by using again and again--more
   drugs, more often.
      We sought help and found none. Often doctors didn't under-
   stand our dilemma. They tried to help by giving us medication.
   Our husbands, wives and loved ones gave us what they had
   and drained themselves in the hope that we would stop using
   or would get better. We tried substituting one drug for another
   but this only prolonged our pain. We tried limiting our usage
   to social amounts without success. There is no such thing as a
   social addict. Some of us sought an answer through churches,
   religions or cultism. Some sought a cure by geographic change.
   We blamed our surroundings and living situations for our prob-
   lems. This attempt to cure our problems by moving gave us a
   chance to take advantage of new people. Some of us sought ap-
   proval through sex or change of friends. This approval-seeking
   behavior carried us further into our addiction. Some of us tried
   marriage, divorce or desertion. Regardless of what we tried, we
   could not escape from our disease.
      We reached a point in our lives where we felt like a lost cause.
   We had little worth to family, friends or on the job. Many of us
   were unemployed and unemployable. Any form of success was
   frightening and unfamiliar. We didn't know what to do. As the
   feeling of self-loathing grew, we needed to use more and more
   to mask our feelings. We were sick and tired of pain and trouble.
   We were frightened and ran from the fear. No matter how far we
   ran, we always carried fear with us. We were hopeless, useless

                                                Why Are We Here? 15


and lost. Failure had become our way of life and self-esteem was
non-existent. Perhaps the most painful feeling of all was the des-
peration. Isolation and denial of our addiction kept us moving
along this downhill path. Any hope of getting better disappeared.
Helplessness, emptiness and fear became our way of life. We were
complete failures. Personality change was what we really needed.
Change from self-destructive patterns of life became necessary.
When we lied, cheated or stole, we degraded ourselves in our own
eyes. We had had enough of self-destruction. We experienced our
powerlessness. When nothing relieved our paranoia and fear, we
hit bottom and became ready to ask for help.
   We were searching for an answer when we reached out and
found Narcotics Anonymous. We came to our first NA meeting
in defeat and didn't know what to expect. After sitting in a meet-
ing, or several meetings, we began to feel that people cared and
were willing to help. Although our minds told us that we would
never make it, the people in the Fellowship gave us hope by
insisting that we could recover. We found that no matter what
our past thoughts or actions were, others had felt and done the
same. Surrounded by fellow addicts, we realized that we were
not alone anymore. Recovery is what happens in our meetings.
Our lives are at stake. We found that by putting recovery first,
the program works. We faced three disturbing realizations:

 1. We are powerless over addiction and our lives are
    unmanageable;

 2. Although we are not responsible for our disease, we are
    responsible for our recovery;

 3. We can no longer blame people, places and things for our
    addiction. We must face our problems and our feelings.

The  ultimate weapon for recovery is the recovering addict. We
concentrate on recovery and feelings not what we have done in
the past. Old friends, places and ideas are often a threat to our

16 Narcotics Anonymous


   recovery. We need to change our playmates, playgrounds and
   playthings.
     When we realize that we are not able to manage without drugs,
   some of us immediately begin experiencing depression, anxiety,
   hostility and resentment. Petty frustrations, minor setbacks and
   loneliness often make us feel that we are not getting any better.
   We find that we suffer from a disease, not a moral dilemma. We
   were critically ill, not hopelessly bad. Our disease can only be
   arrested through abstinence.
     Today, we experience a full range of feelings. Before coming
   into the Fellowship, we either felt elated or depressed. Our nega-
   tive sense of self has been replaced by a positive concern for oth-
   ers. Answers are provided, and problems are solved. It is a great
   gift to feel human again.
     What a change from the way that we used to be! We know the
   NA Program works. The program convinced us that we needed
   to change ourselves, instead of trying to change the people and
   situations around us. We discovered new opportunities. We
   found a sense of self-worth. We learned self-respect. This is a
   program for learning. By working the steps, we come to accept a
   Higher Power's will. Acceptance leads to recovery. We lose our
   fear of the unknown. We are set free.

How It Works

If you want what we have to offer, and are willing to make the
effort to get it, then you are ready to take certain steps. These are
the principles that made our recovery possible.

  1.   We admitted that we were powerless over our addiction,
       that our lives had become unmanageable.
  2.   We came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves
       could restore us to sanity.
  3.   We made a decision to turn our will and our lives over
       to the care of God as we understood Him.
  4.   We made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.
  5.   We admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another
       human being the exact nature of our wrongs.
  6.   We were entirely ready to have God remove all these
       defects of character.
  7.   We humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.
  8.   We made a list of all persons we had harmed,
       and became willing to make amends to them all.
  9.   We made direct amends to such people wherever possible,
       except when to do so would injure them or others.
 10.   We continued to take personal inventory and when we
       were wrong promptly admitted it.
 11.   We sought through prayer and meditation to improve our
       conscious contact with God as we understood Him,
       praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the
       power to carry that out.
 12.   Having had a spiritual awakening as a result of these
       steps, we tried to carry this message to addicts, and to
       practice these principles in all our affairs.

                                  17

18 Narcotics Anonymous



        This sounds like a big order, and we can't do it all at once. We
     didn't become addicted in one day, so remember--easy does it.

        There is one thing more than anything else that will defeat us
     in our recovery; this is an attitude of indifference or intolerance
     toward spiritual principles. Three of these that are indispensable
     are honesty, open-mindedness and willingness. With these we
     are well on our way.

        We feel that our approach to the disease of addiction is
     completely realistic for the therapeutic value of one addict
     helping another is without parallel. We feel that our way is
     practical, for one addict can best understand and help another
     addict. We believe that the sooner we face our problems within
     our society, in everyday living, just that much faster do we
     become acceptable, responsible, and productive members
     of that society.

        The only way to keep from returning to active addiction is
     not to take that first drug. If you are like us you know that
     one is too many and a thousand never enough. We put great
     emphasis on this, for we know that when we use drugs in any
     form, or substitute one for another, we release our addiction
     all over again.

        Thinking of alcohol as different from other drugs has caused
     a great many addicts to relapse. Before we came to NA many
     of us viewed alcohol separately, but we cannot afford to be
     confused about this. Alcohol is a drug. We are people with the
     disease of addiction who must abstain from all drugs in order
     to recover.

   These   are some of the questions we have asked ourselves:
   Are we sure we want to stop using? Do we understand that
   we have no real control over drugs? Do we recognize that in
   the long run, we didn't use drugs--they used us? Did jails and
   institutions take over the management of our lives at different

                                                     How It Works 19


times? Do we fully accept the fact that our every attempt to
stop using or to control our using failed? Do we know that
our addiction changed us into someone we didn't want to be:
dishonest, deceitful, self-willed people at odds with ourselves
and our fellow man? Do we really believe that we have failed
as drug users?
   When we were using, reality became so painful that oblivion
was preferable. We tried to keep other people from knowing
about our pain. We isolated ourselves, and lived in prisons that
we built with loneliness. Through this desperation, we sought
help in Narcotics Anonymous. When we come to NA we are
physically, mentally, and spiritually bankrupt. We have hurt so
long that we are willing to go to any length to stay clean.
   Our only hope is to live by the example of those who have
faced our dilemma and have found a way out. Regardless of
who we are, where we came from, or what we have done, we are
accepted in NA. Our addiction gives us a common ground for
understanding one another.
   As a result of attending a few meetings, we begin to feel like
we finally belong somewhere. It is in these meetings that we are
introduced to the Twelve Steps of Narcotics Anonymous. We
learn to work the steps in the order that they are written and to
use them on a daily basis. The steps are our solution. They are
our survival kit. They are our defense against addiction which
is a deadly disease. Our steps are the principles that make our
recovery possible.


Step One
   "We admitted that we were powerless over our addiction,
   that our lives had become unmanageable."

It doesn't matter what or how much we used. In Narcotics
Anonymous, staying clean has to come first. We realize that we
cannot use drugs and live. When we admit our powerlessness

20 Narcotics Anonymous


   and our inability to manage our own lives, we open the door to
   recovery. No one could convince us that we were addicts. It is an
   admission that we have to make for ourselves. When some of us
   have doubts, we ask ourselves this question: "Can I control my
   use of any form of mind or mood-altering chemicals?"
      Most addicts will see that control is impossible the moment
   it is suggested. Whatever the outcome, we find that we cannot
   control our using for any length of time.
      This would clearly suggest that an addict has no control over
   drugs. Powerlessness means using drugs against our will. If we
   can't stop using, how can we tell ourselves we are in control? The
   inability to stop using, even with the greatest willpower and the
   most sincere desire, is what we mean when we say, "We have ab-
   solutely no choice." However, we do have a choice after we stop
   trying to justify our using.
      We didn't stumble into this Fellowship brimming with love,
   honesty, open-mindedness or willingness. We reached a point
   where we could no longer continue using because of physical,
   mental, and spiritual pain. When we were beaten, we became
   willing.
      Our inability to control our usage of drugs is a symptom of the
   disease of addiction. We are powerless not only over drugs, but
   over our addiction as well. We need to admit this fact in order
   to recover. Addiction is a physical, mental and spiritual disease
   that affects every area of our lives.
      The physical aspect of our disease is the compulsive use of
   drugs: the inability to stop using once we have started. The men-
   tal aspect of our disease is the obsession, or overpowering desire
   to use, even when we are destroying our lives. The spiritual part
   of our disease is our total self-centeredness. We felt that we could
   stop whenever we wanted to, despite all evidence to the con-
   trary. Denial, substitution, rationalization, justification, distrust
   of others, guilt, embarrassment, dereliction, degradation, isola-
   tion, and loss of control are all results of our disease. Our disease

                                                        How It Works 21


is progressive, incurable and fatal. Most of us are relieved to find
out we have a disease instead of a moral deficiency.
   We are not responsible for our disease, but we are responsible
for our recovery. Most of us tried to stop using on our own, but
we were unable to live with or without drugs. Eventually we re-
alized that we were powerless over our addiction.
   Many of us tried to stop using on sheer willpower. This ac-
tion was a temporary solution. We saw that willpower alone
would not work for any length of time. We tried countless other
remedies--psychiatrists, hospitals, recovery houses, lovers, new
towns, new jobs. Everything that we tried, failed. We began to
see that we had rationalized the most outrageous sort of non-
sense to justify the mess that we made of our lives with drugs.
   Until we let go of our reservations, no matter what they are,
the foundation of our recovery is in danger. Reservations rob us
of the benefits that this program has to offer. In ridding ourselves
of all reservations, we surrender. Then, and only then, can we be
helped to recover from the disease of addiction.
   Now, the question is: "If we are powerless, how can Narcotics
Anonymous help?" We begin by asking for help. The founda-
tion of our program is the admission that we, of ourselves, do
not have power over addiction. When we can accept this fact, we
have completed the first part of Step One.
   A second admission must be made before our foundation is
complete. If we stop here, we will know only half the truth. We
are great ones for manipulating the truth. We say on one hand,
"Yes, I am powerless over my addiction," and on the other hand,
"When I get my life together, I can handle drugs." Such thoughts
and actions led us back to active addiction. It never occurred to
us to ask, "If we can't control our addiction, how can we control
our lives?" We felt miserable without drugs, and our lives were
unmanageable.
   Unemployability, dereliction and destruction are easily seen as
characteristics of an unmanageable life. Our families generally

22 Narcotics Anonymous


   are disappointed, baffled and confused by our actions and often
   desert or disown us. Becoming employed, socially acceptable
   and reunited with our families does not make our lives manage-
   able. Social acceptability does not equal recovery.
     We have found that we had no choice except to completely
   change our old ways of thinking or go back to using. When we
   give our best, it works for us as it has worked for others. When
   we could no longer stand our old ways, we began to change.
   From that point forward, we began to see that every clean day is
   a successful day, no matter what happens. Surrender means not
   having to fight anymore. We accept our addiction and life the
   way it is. We become willing to do whatever is necessary to stay
   clean, even the things we don't like doing.
     Until we took Step One, we were full of fear and doubt. At this
   point, many of us felt lost and confused. We felt different. Upon
   working this step, we affirmed our surrender to the principles of
   NA. Only after surrender are we able to overcome the alienation
   of addiction. Help for addicts begins only when we are able to
   admit complete defeat. This can be frightening, but it is the foun-
   dation on which we built our lives.
     Step One means that we do not have to use, and this is a great
   freedom. It took a while for some of us to realize that our lives
   had become unmanageable. For others, the unmanageability
   of their lives was the only thing that was clear. We knew in our
   hearts that drugs had the power to change us into someone that
   we didn't want to be.
     Being clean and working this step, we are released from our
   chains. However, none of the steps work by magic. We do not
   just say the words of this step; we learn to live them. We see for
   ourselves that the program has something to offer us.
     We have found hope. We can learn to function in the world in
   which we live. We can find meaning and purpose in life and be
   rescued from insanity, depravity and death.

                                                          How It Works 23


   When we admit our powerlessness and inability to manage
our own lives, we open the door for a Power greater than our-
selves to help us. It is not where we were that counts, but where
we are going.


Step Two
   "We came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could
   restore us to sanity."

The   Second Step is necessary if we expect to achieve ongoing
recovery. The First Step leaves us with a need to believe in some-
thing that can help us with our powerlessness, uselessness, and
helplessness.
   The First Step has left a vacuum in our lives. We need to find
something to fill that void. This is the purpose of the Second
Step.
   Some of us didn't take this step seriously at first; we passed
over it with a minimum of concern, only to find the next steps
would not work until we worked Step Two. Even when we ad-
mitted that we needed help with our drug problem, many of us
would not admit to the need for faith and sanity.
   We have a disease: progressive, incurable and fatal. One way
or another we went out and bought our destruction on the time
payment plan! All of us, from the junkie snatching purses to the
sweet little old lady hitting two or three doctors for legal pre-
scriptions, have one thing in common: we seek our destruction
a bag at a time, a few pills at a time, or a bottle at a time until we
die. This is at least part of the insanity of addiction. The price
may seem higher for the addict who prostitutes for a fix than it
is for the addict who merely lies to a doctor. Ultimately both pay
for their disease with their lives. Insanity is repeating the same
mistakes and expecting different results.
   Many of us realize when we get to the program that we have
gone back time and again to using, even though we knew that

24 Narcotics Anonymous


   we were destroying our lives. Insanity is using drugs day after
   day knowing that only physical and mental destruction comes
   when we use. The most obvious insanity of the disease of addic-
   tion is the obsession to use drugs.
     Ask yourself this question, Do I believe it would be insane to
   walk up to someone and say, "May I please have a heart attack
   or a fatal accident?" If you can agree that this would be an insane
   thing, you should have no problem with the Second Step.
     In this program, the first thing we do is stop using drugs. At
   this point, we begin to feel the pain of living without drugs or
   anything to replace them. The pain forces us to seek a Power
   greater than ourselves that can relieve our obsession to use.
     The process of coming to believe is similar for most addicts.
   Most of us lacked a working relationship with a Higher Power.
   We begin to develop this relationship by simply admitting to the
   possibility of a Power greater than ourselves. Most of us have no
   trouble admitting that addiction had become a destructive force
   in our lives. Our best efforts resulted in ever greater destruction
   and despair. At some point, we realized that we needed the help
   of some Power greater than our addiction. Our understanding
   of a Higher Power is up to us. No one is going to decide for us.
   We can call it the group, the program, or we can call it God. The
   only suggested guidelines are that this Power be loving, caring
   and greater than ourselves. We don't have to be religious to ac-
   cept this idea. The point is that we open our minds to believe.
   We may have difficulty with this, but by keeping an open mind,
   sooner or later, we find the help we need.
     We talked and listened to others. We saw other people recov-
   ering, and they told us what was working for them. We began
   to see evidence of some Power that could not be fully explained.
   Confronted with this evidence, we began to accept the existence
   of a Power greater than ourselves. We can use this Power long
   before we understand it.

                                                       How It Works 25


  As we see coincidences and miracles happening in our lives,
acceptance becomes trust. We grow to feel comfortable with our
Higher Power as a source of strength. As we learn to trust this
Power, we begin to overcome our fear of life.
  The process of coming to believe restores us to sanity. The
strength to move into action comes from this belief. We need to
accept this step to start on the road to recovery. When our belief
has grown, we are ready for Step Three.


Step Three
  "We made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the
  care of God as we understood Him."

As   addicts, we turned our will and our lives over many times
to a destructive power. Our will and our lives were controlled by
drugs. We were trapped by our need for instant gratification that
drugs gave us. During that time, our total being--body, mind and
spirit--was dominated by drugs. For a time, it was pleasurable,
then the euphoria began to wear off and we saw the ugly side of
addiction. We found that the higher our drugs took us, the lower
they brought us. We faced two choices: either we suffered the pain
of withdrawal or took more drugs.
  For all of us, the day came when there was no longer a choice;
we had to use. Having given our will and lives to our addiction,
in utter desperation, we looked for another way. In Narcotics
Anonymous, we decide to turn our will and our lives over to
the care of God as we understand Him. This is a giant step. We
don't have to be religious; anyone can take this step. All that is
required is willingness. All that is essential is that we open the
door to a Power greater than ourselves.
  Our concept of God comes not from dogma but from what we
believe and from what works for us. Many of us understand God
to be simply whatever force keeps us clean. The right to a God
of your understanding is total and without any catches. Because

26 Narcotics Anonymous


   we have this right, it is necessary to be honest about our belief if
   we are to grow spiritually.
      We found that all we needed to do was try. When we gave
   our best effort, the program worked for us as it has worked for
   countless others. The Third Step does not say, "We turned our
   will and our lives over to the care of God." It says, "We made a
   decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we
   understood Him." We made the decision; it was not made for us
   by the drugs, our families, a probation officer, judge, therapist
   or doctor. We made it! For the first time since that first high, we
   have made a decision for ourselves.
      The word decision implies action. This decision is based on
   faith. We have only to believe that the miracle that we see work-
   ing in the lives of clean addicts can happen to any addict with the
   desire to change. We simply realize there is a force for spiritual
   growth that can help us become more tolerant, patient, and use-
   ful in helping others. Many of us have said, "Take my will and
   my life. Guide me in my recovery. Show me how to live." The
   relief of "letting go and letting God" helps us develop a life that
   is worth living.
      Surrendering to the will of our Higher Power gets easier with
   daily practice. When we honestly try, it works. Many of us start our
   day with a simple request for guidance from our Higher Power.
      Although we know that "turning it over" works, we may still
   take our will and life back. We may even get angry because God
   permits it. At times during our recovery, the decision to ask for
   God's help is our greatest source of strength and courage. We
   cannot make this decision often enough. We surrender quietly,
   and let the God of our understanding take care of us.
      At first, our heads reeled with the questions: "What will hap-
   pen when I turn my life over? Will I be become `perfect'?" We
   may have been more realistic than this. Some of us had to turn
   to an experienced NA member and ask, "What was it like for
   you?" The answer will vary from member to member. Most of

                                                        How It Works 27


us feel open-mindedness, willingness and surrender are the keys
to this step.
  We have surrendered our will and our lives to the care of a
Power greater than ourselves. If we are thorough and sincere, we
will notice a change for the better. Our fears are lessened, and faith
begins to grow as we learn the true meaning of surrender. We are
no longer fighting fear, anger, guilt, self-pity or depression. We
realize that the Power that brought us to this program is still with
us and will continue to guide us if we allow It. We are slowly be-
ginning to lose the paralyzing fear of hopelessness. The proof of
this step is shown in the way we live.
  We have come to enjoy living clean and want more of the good
things that the NA Fellowship holds for us. We know now that
we cannot pause in our spiritual program; we want all that we
can get.
  We are now ready for our first honest self-appraisal, and we
begin with Step Four.


Step Four
  "We made a searching and fearless moral inventory
  of ourselves."

The   purpose of a searching and fearless moral inventory is to
sort through the confusion and the contradiction of our lives, so
that we can find out who we really are. We are starting a new
way of life and need to be rid of the burdens and traps that con-
trolled us and prevented our growth.
  As we approach this step, most of us are afraid that there is a
monster inside of us that, if released, will destroy us. This fear
can cause us to put off our inventory or may even prevent us
from taking this crucial step at all. We have found that fear is a
lack of faith, and we have found a loving, personal God to whom
we can turn. We no longer need to be afraid.

     We have been experts at self-deception and rationalization. By
   writing our inventory, we can overcome these obstacles. A writ-
   ten inventory will unlock parts of our subconscious that remain
   hidden when we simply think about or talk about who we are.
   Once it is all down on paper, it is much easier to see, and much
   harder to deny our true nature. Honest self-assessment is one of
   the keys to our new way of life.
     Let's face it; when we were using, we were not honest with our-
   selves. We are becoming honest with ourselves when we admit
   that addiction has defeated us and that we need help. It took a
   long time to admit that we were beaten. We found that we do not
   recover physically, mentally or spiritually overnight. Step Four
   will help us toward our recovery. Most of us find that we were
   neither as terrible, nor as wonderful, as we supposed. We are sur-
   prised to find that we have good points in our inventory. Anyone
   who has some time in the program and has worked this step will
   tell you that the Fourth Step was a turning point in their life.
     Some of us make the mistake of approaching the Fourth Step
   as if it were a confession of how horrible we are--what a bad
   person we have been. In this new way of life, a binge of emotional
   sorrow can be dangerous. This is not the purpose of the Fourth
   Step. We are trying to free ourselves of living in old, useless pat-
   terns. We take the Fourth Step to grow and to gain strength and
   insight. We may approach the Fourth Step in a number of ways.
     To have the faith and courage to write a fearless inventory,
   Steps One, Two and Three are the necessary preparation. It is
   advisable that before we start, we go over the first three steps
   with a sponsor. We get comfortable with our understanding of
   these steps. We allow ourselves the privilege of feeling good
   about what we are doing. We have been thrashing about for a
   long time and have gotten nowhere. Now we start the Fourth
   Step and let go of fear. We simply put it on paper, to the best of
   our present ability.

                                                       How It Works 29


   We must be done with the past, not cling to it. We want to
look our past in the face, see it for what it really was and release
it so we can live today. The past, for most of us, has been a ghost
in the closet. We have been afraid to open that closet for fear of
what that ghost may do to us. We do not have to look at the past
alone. Our wills and our lives are now in the hands of our Higher
Power.
   Writing a thorough and honest inventory seemed impossible.
It was, as long as we were operating under our own power. We
take a few quiet moments before writing and ask for the strength
to be fearless and thorough.
   In Step Four, we begin to get in touch with ourselves. We
write about our liabilities such as guilt, shame, remorse, self-pity,
resentment, anger, depression, frustration, confusion, loneliness,
anxiety, betrayal, hopelessness, failure, fear and denial.
   We write about the things that bother us here and now. We
have a tendency to think negatively, so putting it on paper gives
us a chance to look more positively at what is happening.
   Assets must also be considered, if we are to get an accurate and
complete picture of ourselves. This is very difficult for most of us,
because it is hard to accept that we have good qualities. However,
we all have assets, many of them newly found in the program,
such as being clean, open-mindedness, God-awareness, honesty
with others, acceptance, positive action, sharing, willingness,
courage, faith, caring, gratitude, kindness and generosity. Also,
our inventories usually include material on relationships.
   We review our past performance and our present behavior to
see what we want to keep and what we want to discard. No one
is forcing us to give up our misery. This step has the reputation
of being difficult; in reality, it is quite simple.
   We write our inventory without considering the Fifth Step.
We work Step Four as if there were no Step Five. We can write
alone or near other people; whatever is more comfortable to
the writer is fine. We can write as long or as short as needed.

   Someone with experience can help. The important thing is to
   write a moral inventory. If the word moral bothers us, we may
   call it a positive/negative inventory.
      The way to write an inventory is to write it! Thinking about an
   inventory, talking about it, theorizing about the inventory will
   not get it written. We sit down with a notebook, ask for guidance,
   pick up our pen and start writing. Anything we think about is
   inventory material. When we realize how little we have to lose,
   and how much we have to gain, we begin this step.
      A basic rule of thumb is that we can write too little, yet we can
   never write too much. The inventory will fit the individual. Per-
   haps this seems difficult or painful. It may appear impossible.
   We may fear that being in touch with our feelings will trigger
   an overwhelming chain reaction of pain and panic. We may feel
   like avoiding an inventory because of a fear of failure. When we
   ignore our feelings, the tension becomes too much for us. The
   fear of impending doom is so great that it overrides our fear of
   failure.
      An inventory becomes a relief, because the pain of doing it
   is less than the pain of not doing it. We learn that pain can be a
   motivating factor in recovery. Thus, facing it becomes unavoid-
   able. Every topic of step meetings seems to be on the Fourth Step
   or doing a daily inventory. Through the inventory process, we
   are able to deal with all the things that can build up. The more
   we live our program, the more God seems to put us in positions
   where issues surface. When issues surface, we write about them.
   We begin enjoying our recovery, because we have a way to re-
   solve shame, guilt, or resentment.
      The stress once trapped inside of us is released. Writing will
   lift the lid off of our pressure cooker. We decide whether we want
   to serve it up, put the lid back on it, or throw it out. We no longer
   have to stew in it.
      We sit down with paper and pen and ask for our God's help
   in revealing the defects that are causing pain and suffering. We

                                                       How It Works 31


pray for the courage to be fearless and thorough and that this
inventory may help us to put our lives in order. When we pray
and take action, it always goes better for us.
  We are not going to be perfect. If we were perfect, we would
not be human. The important thing is that we do our best. We
use the tools available to us, and we develop the ability to sur-
vive our emotions. We do not want to lose any of what we have
gained; we want to continue in the program. It is our experience
that no matter how searching and thorough, no inventory is of
any lasting effect unless it is promptly followed by an equally
thorough Fifth Step.


Step Five
  "We admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human
  being the exact nature of our wrongs."

The   Fifth Step is the key to freedom. It allows us to live clean in
the present. Sharing the exact nature of our wrongs sets us free to
live. After taking a thorough Fourth Step, we deal with the con-
tents of our inventory. We are told that if we keep these defects
inside us, they will lead us back to using. Holding on to our past
would eventually sicken us and keep us from taking part in our
new way of life. If we are not honest when we take a Fifth Step,
we will have the same negative results that dishonesty brought
us in the past.
  Step Five suggests that we admit to God, to ourselves, and to
another human being the exact nature of our wrongs. We looked
at our wrongs, examined our behavior patterns, and started to
see the deeper aspects of our disease. Now we sit with another
person and share our inventory out loud.
  Our Higher Power will be with us during our Fifth Step. We
will receive help and be free to face ourselves and another hu-
man being. It seemed unnecessary to admit the exact nature
of our wrongs to our Higher Power. "God already knows that

32 Narcotics Anonymous


   stuff," we rationalized. Although He already knows, the admis-
   sion must come from our own lips to be truly effective. Step Five
   is not simply a reading of Step Four.
      For years, we avoided seeing ourselves as we really were. We
   were ashamed of ourselves and felt isolated from the rest of the
   world. Now that we have the shameful part of our past trapped,
   we can sweep it out of our lives if we face and admit it. It would
   be tragic to write it all down and then shove it in a drawer. These
   defects grow in the dark, and die in the light of exposure.
      Before coming to Narcotics Anonymous, we felt that no one
   could understand the things that we had done. We feared that
   if we ever revealed ourselves as we were, we would surely be
   rejected. Most addicts are uncomfortable about this. We recog-
   nize that we have been unrealistic in feeling this way. Our fellow
   members do understand us.
      We must carefully choose the person who is to hear our Fifth
   Step. We must make sure that they know what we are doing and
   why we are doing it. Although there is no hard rule about the
   person of our choice, it is important that we trust the person.
   Only complete confidence in the person's integrity and discre-
   tion can make us willing to be thorough in this step. Some of us
   take our Fifth Step with a total stranger, although some of us feel
   more comfortable choosing a member of Narcotics Anonymous.
   We know that another addict would be less likely to judge us
   with malice or misunderstanding.
      Once we make a choice and are actually alone with that
   person, we proceed with their encouragement. We want to be
   definite, honest and thorough, realizing that this is a life and
   death matter.
      Some of us tried to hide part of our past in an attempt to find
   an easier way of dealing with our inner feelings. We may think
   that we have done enough by writing about our past. We can-
   not afford this mistake. This step will expose our motives and
   our actions. We cannot expect these things to reveal themselves.

                                                      How It Works 33


Our embarrassment is eventually overcome, and we can avoid
future guilt.
  We do not procrastinate. We must be exact. We want to tell the
simple truth, cut and dried, as quickly as possible. There is al-
ways a danger that we will exaggerate our wrongs. It is equally
dangerous to minimize or rationalize our part in past situations.
After all, we still want to sound good.
  Addicts tend to live secret lives. For many years, we covered
low self-esteem by hiding behind phony images that we hoped
would fool people. Unfortunately, we fooled ourselves more
than anyone. Although we often appeared attractive and con-
fident on the outside, we were really hiding a shaky, insecure
person on the inside. The masks have to go. We share our inven-
tory as it is written, skipping nothing. We continue to approach
this step with honesty and thoroughness until we finish. It is a
great relief to get rid of all our secrets and to share the burden
of our past.
  Usually, as we share this step, the listener will share some of
his or her story too. We find that we are not unique. We see, by
the acceptance of our confidant, that we can be accepted just the
way we are.
  We may never be able to remember all of our past mistakes.
We do, however, give it our best and most complete effort. We
begin to experience real personal feelings of a spiritual nature.
Where once we had spiritual theories, we now begin to awaken
to spiritual reality. This initial examination of ourselves usually
reveals some behavior patterns that we don't particularly like.
However, facing these patterns and bringing them out in the
open makes it possible for us to deal with them constructively.
We cannot make these changes alone. We will need the help of
God, as we understand Him, and the Fellowship of Narcotics
Anonymous.

   Step Six
      "We were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects
      of character."

   Why    ask for something before we are ready for it? This would
   be asking for trouble. So many times addicts have sought the
   rewards of hard work without the labor. Willingness is what we
   strive for in Step Six. How sincerely we work this step will be
   proportionate to our desire for change.
      Do we really want to be rid of our resentments, our anger, our
   fear? Many of us cling to our fears, doubts, self-loathing or ha-
   tred because there is a certain distorted security in familiar pain.
   It seems safer to embrace what we know than to let go of it for
   the unknown.
      Letting go of character defects should be done decisively. We
   suffer because their demands weaken us. Where we were proud,
   we now find that we cannot get away with arrogance. If we are
   not humble, we are humiliated. If we are greedy, we find that we
   are never satisfied. Before taking Steps Four and Five, we could
   indulge in fear, anger, dishonesty or self-pity. Now indulgence in
   these character defects clouds our ability to think logically. Self-
   ishness becomes an intolerable, destructive chain that ties us to
   our bad habits. Our defects drain us of all our time and energy.
      We examine the Fourth Step inventory and get a good look at
   what these defects are doing to our lives. We begin to long for
   freedom from these defects. We pray or otherwise become will-
   ing, ready and able to let God remove these destructive traits.
   We need a personality change, if we are to stay clean. We want
   to change.
      We should approach old defects with an open mind. We are
   aware of them and yet we still make the same mistakes and are
   unable to break the bad habits. We look to the Fellowship for
   the kind of life that we want for ourselves. We ask our friends,
   "Did you let go?" Almost without exception the answer is, "Yes,

                                                       How It Works 35


to the best of my ability." When we see how our defects exist in
our lives and accept them, we can let go of them and get on with
our new life. We learn that we are growing when we make new
mistakes instead of repeating old ones.
  When we are working Step Six, it is important to remember
that we are human and should not place unrealistic expectations
on ourselves. This is a step of willingness. Willingness is the spir-
itual principle of Step Six. Step Six helps us move in a spiritual
direction. Being human we will wander off course.
  Rebellion is a character defect that spoils us here. We need not
lose faith when we become rebellious. Rebellion can produce
indifference or intolerance which can be overcome by persistent
effort. We keep asking for willingness. We may be doubtful that
God will see fit to relieve us or that something will go wrong.
We ask another member who says, "You're right where you're
supposed to be." We renew our readiness to have our defects
removed. We surrender to the simple suggestions that the pro-
gram offers us. Even though we are not entirely ready, we are
headed in the right direction.
  Eventually faith, humility and acceptance replace pride
and rebellion. We come to know ourselves. We find ourselves
growing into mature consciousness. We begin to feel better, as
willingness grows into hope. Perhaps for the first time, we see a
vision of our new life. With this in sight, we put our willingness
into action by moving on to Step Seven.


Step Seven
  "We humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings."

Character   defects or shortcomings are those things that cause
pain and misery all of our lives. If they contributed to our health
and happiness, we would not have come to such a state of
desperation. We had to become ready to have God, as we under-
stood Him, remove these defects.

36 Narcotics Anonymous


     Having decided that we want God to relieve us of the use-
   less or destructive aspects of our personalities, we have arrived
   at the Seventh Step. We couldn't handle the ordeal of life all by
   ourselves. It wasn't until we made a real mess of our lives that we
   realized we couldn't do it alone. By admitting this, we achieved
   a glimpse of humility. This is the main ingredient of Step Seven.
   Humility is a result of getting honest with ourselves. We have
   practiced being honest since Step One. We accepted our addic-
   tion and powerlessness. We found a strength beyond ourselves
   and learned to rely on it. We examined our lives and discovered
   who we really are. To be truly humble is to accept and honestly
   try to be ourselves. None of us is perfectly good or perfectly bad.
   We are people who have assets and liabilities. Most importantly,
   we are human.
     Humility is as much a part of staying clean as food and water
   are to staying alive. As our addiction progressed, we devoted
   our energy toward satisfying our material desires. All other
   needs were beyond our reach. We always wanted gratification
   of our basic desires.
     The Seventh Step is an action step, and it is time to ask God for
   help and relief. We have to understand that our way of thinking is
   not the only way; other people can give us direction. When some-
   one points out a shortcoming, our first reaction may be defensive.
   We must realize that we are not perfect. There will always be room
   for growth. If we truly want to be free, we will take a good look
   at input from fellow addicts. If the shortcomings we discover are
   real, and we have a chance to be rid of them, we will surely experi-
   ence a sense of well-being.
     Some will want to get on their knees for this step. Some will be
   very quiet, and others will put forth a great emotional effort to
   show intense willingness. The word humble applies because we
   approach this Power greater than ourselves to ask for the free-
   dom to live without the limitations of our past ways. Many of us
   are willing to work this step without reservations, on pure blind

                                                      How It Works 37


faith, because we are sick of what we have been doing and how
we are feeling. Whatever works, we go all the way.
  This is our road to spiritual growth. We change every day.
We gradually and carefully pull ourselves out of the isolation
and loneliness of addiction and into the mainstream of life. This
growth is not the result of wishing, but of action and prayer. The
main objective of Step Seven is to get out of ourselves and strive
to achieve the will of our Higher Power.
  If we are careless and fail to grasp the spiritual meaning of
this step, we may have difficulties and stir up old troubles. One
danger is in being too hard on ourselves.
  Sharing with other recovering addicts will help us to avoid
becoming morbidly serious about ourselves. Accepting the de-
fects of others can help us become humble and pave the way for
our own defects to be relieved. God often works through those
who care enough about recovery to help make us aware of our
shortcomings.
  We have noticed that humility plays a big part in this program
and our new way of life. We take our inventory; we become ready
to let God remove our defects of character; we humbly ask Him
to remove our shortcomings. This is our road to spiritual growth,
and we will want to continue. We are ready for Step Eight.


Step Eight
  "We made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became
  willing to make amends to them all."

Step  Eight is the test of our newfound humility. Our purpose is to
achieve freedom from the guilt that we have carried. We want to
look the world in the eye with neither aggressiveness nor fear.
  Are we willing to make a list of all persons we had harmed
to clear away the fear and guilt that our past holds for us? Our
experience tells us that we must become willing before this step
will have any effect.

38 Narcotics Anonymous


      The Eighth Step is not easy; it demands a new kind of honesty
   about our relations with other people. The Eighth Step starts the
   process of forgiveness: We forgive others; possibly we are for-
   given; and finally we forgive ourselves and learn how to live in
   the world. By the time we reach this step, we have become ready
   to understand rather than to be understood. We can live and let
   live easier when we know the areas in which we owe amends. It
   seems hard now, but once we have done it, we will wonder why
   we did not do it long ago.
      We need some real honesty before we can make an accurate
   list. In preparing to make the Eighth Step list, it is helpful to de-
   fine harm. One definition of harm is physical or mental damage.
   Another definition of harm is inflicting pain, suffering or loss.
   The damage may be caused by something that is said, done or
   left undone. Harm can result from words or actions, either in-
   tentional or unintentional. The degree of harm can range from
   making someone feel mentally uncomfortable to inflicting bodi-
   ly injury or even death.
      The Eighth Step presents us with a problem. Many of us have
   difficulty admitting that we caused harm for others, because we
   thought we were victims of our addiction. Avoiding this ration-
   alization is crucial to the Eighth Step. We must separate what
   was done to us from what we did to others. We cut away our
   justifications and our ideas of being a victim. We often feel that
   we only harmed ourselves, yet we usually list ourselves last, if
   at all. This step is doing the legwork to repair the wreckage of
   our lives.
      It will not make us better people to judge the faults of another.
   It will make us feel better to clean up our lives by relieving our-
   selves of guilt. By writing our list, we can no longer deny that
   we caused harm. We admit that we hurt others, directly or indi-
   rectly, through some action, lie, broken promise or neglect.
      We make our list, or take it from our Fourth Step, and add ad-
   ditional people as we think of them. We face this list honestly,

                                                       How It Works 39


and openly examine our faults so we can become willing to make
amends.
  In some cases, we may not know the persons that we have
wronged. While using, anyone that we contacted was at risk.
Many members mention their parents, spouses, children, friends,
lovers, other addicts, casual acquaintances, co-workers, employ-
ers, teachers, landlords and total strangers. We may also place
ourselves on the list, because while practicing our addiction,
we have slowly been killing ourselves. We may find it benefi-
cial to make a separate list of people to whom we owe financial
amends.
  As with each step, we must be thorough. Most of us fall short
of our goals more often than we exceed them. At the same time,
we cannot put off completion of this step just because we are not
sure that our list is complete. We are never finished.
  The final difficulty in working the Eighth Step is separating it
from the Ninth Step. Projections about actually making amends
can be a major obstacle both in making the list and in becoming
willing. We do this step as if there were no Ninth Step. We do not
even think about making the amends but just concentrate on ex-
actly what the Eighth Step says: make a list and become willing.
The main thing this step does for us is to help build awareness
that, little by little, we are gaining new attitudes about ourselves
and how we deal with other people.
  Listening carefully to other members share their experience
regarding this step can relieve any confusion that we may have
about writing our list.Also, our sponsors may share with us how
Step Eight worked for them. Asking a question during a meeting
can give us the benefit of group conscience.
  The Eighth Step offers a big change from a life dominated by
guilt and remorse. Our futures are changed, because we don't
have to avoid those who we have harmed.As a result of this step,
we receive a new freedom that can end isolation. As we realize
our need to be forgiven, we tend to be more forgiving. At least,

40 Narcotics Anonymous


   we know that we are no longer intentionally making life miser-
   able for people.
     The Eighth Step is an action step. Like all the steps, it offers
   immediate benefits. We are now free to begin our amends in
   Step Nine.


   Step Nine
     "We made direct amends to such people wherever possible,
     except when to do so would injure them or others."

   This  step should not be avoided. If we do, we are reserving a
   place in our program for relapse. Pride, fear and procrastination
   often seem an impossible barrier; they stand in the way of prog-
   ress and growth. The important thing is to take action and to be
   ready to accept the reactions of those persons we have harmed.
   We make amends to the best of our ability.
     Timing is an essential part of this step. We should make
   amends when the opportunity presents itself, except when to do
   so will cause more harm. Sometimes we cannot actually make
   the amends; it is neither possible nor practical. In some cases,
   amends may be beyond our means. We find that willingness can
   serve in the place of action where we are unable to contact the per-
   son that we have harmed. However, we should never fail to con-
   tact anyone because of embarrassment, fear or procrastination.
     We want to be free of our guilt, but we don't wish to do so at
   the expense of anyone else. We might run the risk of involving a
   third person or some companion from our using days who does
   not wish to be exposed. We do not have the right or the need to
   endanger another person. It is often necessary to take guidance
   from others in these matters.
     We recommend turning our legal problems over to law-
   yers and our financial or medical problems to professionals.
   Part of learning how to live successfully is learning when we
   need help.

                                                       How It Works 41


   In some old relationships, an unresolved conflict may still
exist. We do our part to resolve old conflicts by making our
amends. We want to step away from further antagonisms and
ongoing resentments. In many instances, we can only go to
the person and humbly ask for understanding of past wrongs.
Sometimes this will be a joyous occasion when old friends or
relatives prove willing to let go of their bitterness. Contacting
someone who is still hurting from the burn of our misdeeds can
be dangerous. Indirect amends may be necessary where direct
ones would be unsafe or endanger other people. We make our
amends to the best of our ability. We try to remember that when
we make amends, we are doing it for ourselves. Instead of feel-
ing guilty and remorseful, we feel relieved about our past.
   We accept that it was our actions that caused our negative at-
titude. Step Nine helps us with our guilt and helps others with
their anger. Sometimes, the only amend we can make is to stay
clean. We owe it to ourselves and to our loved ones. We are no
longer making a mess in society as a result of our using. Some-
times the only way we can make amends is to contribute to soci-
ety. Now, we are helping ourselves and other addicts to recover.
This is a tremendous amend to the whole community.
   In the process of our recovery, we are restored to sanity and
part of sanity is effectively relating to others. We less often view
people as a threat to our security. Real security will replace the
physical ache and mental confusion that we have experienced
in the past. We approach those we have harmed with humility
and patience. Many of our sincere well-wishers may be reluctant
to accept our recovery as real. We must remember the pain that
they have known. In time, many miracles will occur. Many of us
who were separated from our families succeed in establishing
relationships with them. Eventually it becomes easier for them to
accept the change in us. Clean time speaks for itself. Patience is
an important part of our recovery. The unconditional love we ex-
perience will rejuvenate our will to live, and each positive move

42 Narcotics Anonymous


   on our part will be matched by an unexpected opportunity. A
   lot of courage and faith goes into making an amend, and a lot of
   spiritual growth results.
     We are achieving freedom from the wreckage of our past. We
   will want to keep our house in order by practicing a continuous
   personal inventory in Step Ten.


   Step Ten
     "We continued to take personal inventory and when we were
     wrong promptly admitted it."

   Step  Ten frees us from the wreckage of our present. If we do not
  stay aware of our defects, they can drive us into a corner that we
  can't get out of clean.
     One of the first things we learn in Narcotics Anonymous is
  that if we use, we lose. By the same token, we won't experience
  as much pain if we can avoid the things that cause us pain. Con-
  tinuing to take a personal inventory means that we form a habit
  of looking at ourselves, our actions, attitudes and relationships
  on a regular basis.
     We are creatures of habit and are vulnerable to our old ways
  of thinking and reacting. At times it seems easier to continue in
  the old rut of self-destruction than to attempt a new and seem-
  ingly dangerous route. We don't have to be trapped by our old
  patterns. Today, we have a choice.
     The Tenth Step can help us correct our living problems and
  prevent their recurrence. We examine our actions during the
  day. Some of us write about our feelings, explaining how we felt
  and what part we might have played in any problems which oc-
  curred. Did we cause someone harm? Do we need to admit that
  we were wrong? If we find difficulties, we make an effort to take
  care of them. When these things are left undone, they have a way
  of festering.

                                                        How It Works 43


   This step can be a defense against the old insanity. We can ask
ourselves if we are being drawn into old patterns of anger, re-
sentment or fear. Do we feel trapped? Are we setting ourselves
up for trouble? Are we too hungry, angry, lonely or tired? Are
we taking ourselves too seriously? Are we judging our insides
by the outside appearances of others? Do we suffer from some
physical problem? The answers to these questions can help us
deal with the difficulties of the moment. We no longer have to
live with the feeling that we have a "hole in the gut." A lot of our
chief concerns and major difficulties come from our inexperience
with living without drugs. Often when we ask an oldtimer what
to do, we are amazed at the simplicity of the answer.
   The Tenth Step can be a pressure relief valve. We work this
step while the day's ups and downs are still fresh in our minds.
We list what we have done and try not to rationalize our actions.
This may be done in writing at the end of the day. The first thing
we do is stop! Then we take the time to allow ourselves the privi-
lege of thinking. We examine our actions, reactions, and motives.
We often find that we've been doing better than we've been
feeling. This allows us to examine our actions and admit fault,
before things get any worse. We need to avoid rationalizing. We
promptly admit our faults, not explain them.
   We work this step continuously. This is a preventive action.
The more we work this step the less we will need the corrective
part of this step. This step is a great tool for avoiding grief before
we bring it on ourselves. We monitor our feelings, emotions,
fantasies and actions. By constantly looking at ourselves, we are
able to avoid repeating the actions that make us feel bad.
   We need this step even when we're feeling good and when
things are going well. Good feelings are new to us, and we need
to nurture them. In times of trouble, we can try the things that
worked during the good times. We have the right to feel good.
We have a choice. The good times can also be a trap; the danger
is that we may forget that our first priority is to stay clean. For
us, recovery is more than just pleasure.

      We need to remember that everyone makes mistakes. We will
   never be perfect. However, we can accept ourselves by using
   Step Ten. By continuing a personal inventory, we are set free, in
   the here and now, from ourselves and the past. We no longer jus-
   tify our existence. This step allows us to be ourselves.


   Step Eleven
      "We sought through prayer and meditation to improve
      our conscious contact with God as we understood Him,
      praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power
      to carry that out."

   The   first ten steps have set the stage for us to improve our
   conscious contact with the God of our understanding. They give
   us the foundation to achieve our long-sought, positive goals.
   Having entered this phase of our spiritual program through
   practicing the previous ten steps, most of us welcome the exer-
   cise of prayer and meditation. Our spiritual condition is the basis
   for a successful recovery that offers unlimited growth.
      Many of us really begin to appreciate our recovery when we
   get to the Eleventh Step. In the Eleventh Step, our lives take on a
   deeper meaning. By surrendering control, we gain a far greater
   power.
      The nature of our belief will determine the manner of our
   prayers and meditations. We need only make sure that we have
   a system of belief that works for us. Results count in recovery.
   As has been noted elsewhere, our prayers seemed to work as
   soon as we entered the Program of Narcotics Anonymous and
   we surrendered to our disease. The conscious contact described
   in this step is the direct result of living the steps. We use this step
   to improve and maintain our spiritual condition.
      When we first came into the program, we received help from
   a Power greater than ourselves. This was set in motion by our

                                                      How It Works 45


surrender to the program. The purpose of the Eleventh Step is to
increase our awareness of that Power and to improve our ability
to use it as a source of strength in our new lives.
   The more we improve our conscious contact with our God
through prayer and meditation, the easier it is to say, "Your will,
not mine, be done." We can ask for God's help when we need
it, and our lives get better. The experiences that some people
talk about regarding meditation and individual religious beliefs
don't always apply to us. Ours is a spiritual, not a religious pro-
gram. By the time we get to the Eleventh Step, character defects
that caused problems in the past have been addressed by work-
ing the preceding ten steps. The image of the kind of person that
we would like to be is a fleeting glimpse of God's will for us. Of-
ten our outlook is so limited that we can only see our immediate
wants and needs.
   It is easy to slip back into our old ways. To ensure our contin-
ued growth and recovery, we have to learn to maintain our lives
on a spiritually sound basis. God will not force His goodness on
us, but we will receive it if we ask. We usually feel something
is different in the moment, but don't see the change in our lives
till later. When we finally get our own selfish motives out of the
way, we begin to find a peace that we never imagined possible.
Enforced morality lacks the power that comes to us when we
choose to live a spiritual life. Most of us pray when we are hurt-
ing. We learn that if we pray regularly we won't be hurting as
often, or as intensely.
   Outside of Narcotics Anonymous, there are any number
of different groups practicing meditation. Nearly all of these
groups are connected with a particular religion or philosophy.
An endorsement of any one of these methods would be a viola-
tion of our traditions and a restriction on the individual's right
to have a God of his understanding. Meditation allows us to de-
velop spiritually in our own way. Some of the things that didn't
work for us in the past, might work today. We take a fresh look at

46 Narcotics Anonymous


   each day with an open mind. We know that if we pray for God's
   will, we will receive what is best for us, regardless of what we
   think. This knowledge is based on our belief and experience as
   recovering addicts.
     Prayer is communicating our concerns to a Power greater than
   ourselves. Sometimes when we pray, a remarkable thing hap-
   pens; we find the means, ways and energies to perform tasks far
   beyond our capacities. We grasp the limitless strength provided
   for us through our daily prayer and surrender, as long as we
   keep faith and renew it.
     For some, prayer is asking for God's help; meditation is lis-
   tening for God's answer. We learn to be careful of praying for
   specific things. We pray that God will show us His will, and that
   He will help us carry that out. In some cases, he makes His will
   so obvious to us that we have little difficulty seeing it. In others,
   our egos are so self-centered that we won't accept God's will for
   us without another struggle and surrender. If we pray for God
   to remove any distracting influences, the quality of our prayers
   usually improves and we feel the difference. Prayer takes prac-
   tice, and we should remind ourselves that skilled people were
   not born with their skills. It took lots of effort on their part to de-
   velop them. Through prayer, we seek conscious contact with our
   God. In meditation, we achieve this contact, and the Eleventh
   Step helps us to maintain it.
     We may have been exposed to many religions and medita-
   tive disciplines before coming to Narcotics Anonymous. Some
   of us were devastated and completely confused by these prac-
   tices. We were sure that it was God's will for us to use drugs to
   reach higher consciousness. Many of us found ourselves in very
   strange states as a result of these practices. We never suspected
   the damaging effects of our addiction as the root of our difficulty
   and pursued to the end whatever path offered hope.
     In quiet moments of meditation, God's will can become evi-
   dent to us. Quieting the mind through meditation brings an

                                                         How It Works 47


inner peace that brings us into contact with the God within us.
A basic premise of meditation is that it is difficult, if not impos-
sible, to obtain conscious contact unless our mind is still. The
usual, never-ending succession of thoughts has to cease for prog-
ress to be made. So our preliminary practice is aimed at stilling
the mind, and letting the thoughts that arise die a natural death.
We leave our thoughts behind as the meditation part of the Elev-
enth Step becomes a reality for us.
   Emotional balance is one of the first results of meditation, and
our experience bears this out. Some of us came into the program
broken, and hung around for awhile, only to find God or salva-
tion in one kind of religious cult or another. It is easy to float back
out the door on a cloud of religious zeal and forget that we are
addicts with an incurable disease.
   It is said that for meditation to be of value, the results must
show in our daily lives. This fact is implicit in the Eleventh Step:
"...His will for us and the power to carry it out." For those of
us who do not pray, meditation is our only way of working this
step.
   We find ourselves praying, because it brings us peace and re-
stores our confidence and courage. It helps us to live a life that
is free of fear and distrust. When we remove our selfish motives
and pray for guidance, we find feelings of peace and serenity.
We begin to experience an awareness and an empathy with other
people that was not possible before working this step.
   As we seek our personal contact with God, we begin to open
up as a flower in the sun. We begin to see that God's love has
been present all the time, just waiting for us to accept it. We do
the footwork and accept what's being given to us freely on a
daily basis. We find relying on God becomes more comfortable
for us.
   When we first come to the program, we usually ask for a lot of
things that seem to be important wants and needs. As we grow
spiritually and find a Power greater than ourselves, we begin

48 Narcotics Anonymous


   to realize that as long as our spiritual needs are met, our living
   problems are reduced to a point of comfort. When we forget
   where our real strength lies, we quickly become subject to the
   same patterns of thinking and action that got us to the program
   in the first place. We eventually redefine our beliefs and under-
   standing to the point where we see that our greatest need is for
   knowledge of God's will for us and the strength to carry that
   out. We are able to set aside some of our personal preference, be-
   cause we learn that God's will for us consists of the very things
   we most value. God's will for us becomes our own true will for
   ourselves. This happens in an intuitive manner that cannot be
   adequately explained in words.
     We become willing to let other people be who they are without
   having to pass judgment on them. The urgency to take care of
   things isn't there anymore. We couldn't comprehend acceptance
   in the beginning; today we can.
     We know that whatever the day brings, God has given us
   everything we need for our spiritual well-being. It is all right for
   us to admit powerlessness, because God is powerful enough to
   help us stay clean and to enjoy spiritual progress. God is helping
   us to get our house in order.
     We begin to see more clearly what is real. Through constant
   contact with our Higher Power, the answers that we seek come
   to us. We gain the ability to do what we once could not. We re-
   spect the beliefs of others. We encourage you to seek strength
   and guidance according to your belief.
     We are thankful for this step, because we begin to get what is
   best for us. Sometimes we prayed for our wants and got trapped
   once we got them. We could pray and get something, then have
   to pray for its removal, because we couldn't handle it.
     Hopefully, having learned the power of prayer and the
   responsibility prayer brings with it, we can use the Eleventh Step
   as a guideline for our daily program.

                                                       How It Works 49


  We begin to pray only for God's will for us. This way we are get-
ting only what we are capable of handling. We are able to respond
to it and handle it, because God helps us prepare for it. Some of us
simply use our words to give thanks for God's grace.
  In an attitude of surrender and humility, we approach this step
again and again to receive the gift of knowledge and strength
from the God of our understanding. The Tenth Step clears away
the errors of the present so we may work the Eleventh Step. With-
out this step, it is unlikely that we could experience a spiritual
awakening, practice spiritual principles in our lives or carry a
sufficient message to attract others to recovery. There is a spiritual
principle of giving away what we have been given in Narcotics
Anonymous in order to keep it. By helping others to stay clean,
we enjoy the benefit of the spiritual wealth that we have found.
We must give freely and gratefully that which has been freely and
gratefully given to us.


Step Twelve
  "Having had a spiritual awakening as a result of these steps,
  we tried to carry this message to addicts, and to practice these
  principles in all our affairs."

We    came to NarcoticsAnonymous as the result of the wreckage
of our past. The last thing we expected was an awakening of the
spirit. We just wanted to stop hurting.
  The steps lead to an awakening of a spiritual nature. This
awakening is evidenced by changes in our lives. These changes
make us better able to live by spiritual principles and to carry
our message of recovery and hope to the addict who still suffers.
The message, however, is meaningless unless we live it. As we
live it, our lives and actions give it more meaning than our words
and literature ever could.
  The idea of a spiritual awakening takes many different forms
in the different personalities that we find in the Fellowship.

50 Narcotics Anonymous


   However, all spiritual awakenings have some things in common.
   Common elements include an end to loneliness and a sense of
   direction in our lives. Many of us believe that a spiritual awaken-
   ing is meaningless unless accompanied by an increase in peace
   of mind and a concern for others. In order to maintain peace of
   mind, we strive to live in the here and now.
     Those of us who have worked these steps to the best of our
   ability received many benefits. We believe that these benefits are
   a direct result of living this program.
     When we first begin to enjoy relief from our addiction, we
   run the risk of assuming control of our lives again. We forget the
   agony and pain that we have known. Our disease controlled our
   lives when we were using. It is ready and waiting to take over
   again. We quickly forget that all our past efforts at controlling
   our lives failed.
     By this time, most of us realize that the only way that we can
   keep what was given to us is by sharing this new gift of life with
   the still-suffering addict. This is our best insurance against re-
   lapse to the torturous existence of using. We call it carrying the
   message, and we do it in a number of ways.
     In the Twelfth Step, we practice the spiritual principles of giv-
   ing the NA message of recovery in order to keep it. Even a mem-
   ber with one day in the NA Fellowship can carry the message
   that this program works.
     When we share with someone new, we may ask to be used as a
   spiritual instrument of our Higher Power. We don't set ourselves
   up as gods. We often ask for the help of another recovering ad-
   dict when sharing with a new person. It is a privilege to respond
   to a cry for help. We, who have been in the pits of despair, feel
   fortunate to help others find recovery.
     We help new people learn the principles of Narcotics Anony-
   mous. We try to make them feel welcome and help them learn
   what the program has to offer. We share our experience, strength
   and hope. Whenever possible, we accompany newcomers to a
   meeting.

                                                     How It Works 51


   The selfless service of this work is the very principle of Step
Twelve. We received our recovery from the God of our under-
standing. We now make ourselves available as His tool to share
recovery with those who seek it. Most of us learn that we can
only carry our message to someone who is asking for help. Some-
times, the only message necessary to make the suffering addict
reach out is the power of example. An addict may be suffering
but unwilling to ask for help. We can make ourselves available to
these people, so when they ask, someone will be there.
   Learning to help others is a benefit of the Narcotics Anony-
mous Program. Remarkably, working the Twelve Steps guides
us from humiliation and despair to acting as instruments of our
Higher Power. We are given the ability to help a fellow addict
when no one else can. We see it happening among us every day.
This miraculous turnabout is evidence of spiritual awakening.
We share from our own personal experience what it has been like
for us. The temptation to give advice is great, but when we do so
we lose the respect of newcomers. This clouds our message. A
simple, honest message of recovery from addiction rings true.
   We attend meetings and make ourselves visible and avail-
able to serve the Fellowship. We give freely and gratefully of
our time, service, and what we have found here. The service we
speak of in Narcotics Anonymous is the primary purpose of our
groups. Service work is carrying the message to the addict who
still suffers. The more eagerly we wade in and work, the richer
our spiritual awakening will be.
   The first way that we carry the message speaks for itself. Peo-
ple see us on the street and remember us as devious, frightened
loners. They notice the fear leaving our faces. They see us gradu-
ally come alive.
   Once we find the NA way, boredom and complacency have
no place in our new life. By staying clean, we begin to practice
spiritual principles such as hope, surrender, acceptance, honesty,
open-mindedness, willingness, faith, tolerance, patience, humility,

52 Narcotics Anonymous


   unconditional love, sharing and caring. As our recovery progress-
   es, spiritual principles touch every area of our lives, because we
   simply try to live this program in the here and now.
     We find joy as we start to learn how to live by the principles
   of recovery. It is the joy of watching as a person two days clean
   says to a person with one day clean, "An addict alone is in bad
   company." It is the joy of watching a person who was struggling
   to make it suddenly, in the middle of helping another addict to
   stay clean, become able to find the words needed to carry the
   message of recovery.
     We feel that our lives have become worthwhile. Spiritually re-
   freshed, we are glad to be alive. When we were using, our lives
   became an exercise in survival. Now we are doing much more
   living than surviving. Realizing that the bottom line is staying
   clean, we can enjoy life. We like being clean and enjoy carrying
   the message of recovery to the addict who still suffers. Going to
   meetings really works.
     Practicing spiritual principles in our daily lives leads us to a
   new image of ourselves. Honesty, humility and open-mindedness
   help us to treat our associates fairly. Our decisions become tem-
   pered with tolerance. We learn to respect ourselves.
     The lessons we learn in our recovery are sometimes bitter and
   painful. By helping others we find the reward of self-respect, as
   we are able to share these lessons with other members of Nar-
   cotics Anonymous. We cannot deny other addicts their pain, but
   we can carry the message of hope that was given to us by fellow
   addicts in recovery. We share the principles of recovery, as they
   have worked in our lives. God helps us as we help each other.
   Life takes on a new meaning, a new joy, and a quality of being
   and feeling worthwhile. We become spiritually refreshed and
   are glad to be alive. One aspect of our spiritual awakening comes
   through the new understanding of our Higher Power that we
   develop by sharing another addict's recovery.

  Yes, we are a vision of hope. We are examples of the program
working. The joy that we have in living clean is an attraction to
the addict who still suffers.
  We do recover to live clean and happy lives. Welcome to NA.
The steps do not end here. The steps are a new beginning!

                            Chapter Five



What Can I Do?

  Begin your own program by taking Step One from the previous
  chapter, How It Works. When we fully concede to our innermost
  selves that we are powerless over our addiction, we have taken a
  big step in our recovery. Many of us have had some reservations
  at this point, so give yourself a break and be as thorough as
  possible from the start. Go on to Step Two, and so forth, and as
  you go on you will come to an understanding of the program
  for yourself. If you are in an institution of any kind and have
  stopped using for the present, you can with a clear mind try this
  way of life.
     Upon release, continue your daily program and contact a
  member of NA. Do this by mail, by phone, or in person. Better
  yet, come to our meetings. Here, you will find answers to some
  of the things that may be disturbing you now.
     If you are not in an institution, the same holds true. Stop
  using for today. Most of us can do for eight or twelve hours what
  seems impossible for a longer period of time. If the obsession or
  compulsion becomes too great, put yourself on a five minute
  basis of not using. Minutes will grow to hours, and hours to
  days, so you will break the habit and gain some peace of mind.
  The real miracle happens when you realize that the need for
  drugs has in some way been lifted from you. You have stopped
  using and have started to live.

The  first step to recovery is to stop using. We cannot expect the
program to work for us if our minds and bodies are still clouded
by drugs. We can do this anywhere, even in prison or an institu-




                                  54

tion. We do it anyway we can, cold turkey or in a detox, just as
long as we get clean.
   Developing the concept of God as we understand Him is a
project that we can undertake. We can also use the steps to im-
prove our attitudes. Our best thinking got us into trouble. We
recognize the need for change. Our disease involved much more
than just using drugs, so our recovery must involve much more
than simple abstinence. Recovery is an active change in our ideas
and attitudes.
   The ability to face problems is necessary to stay clean. If we
had problems in the past, it is unlikely that simple abstinence
will solve these problems. Guilt and worry can keep us from liv-
ing in the here and now. Denial of our disease and other reserva-
tions keep us sick. Many of us feel that we cannot possibly have
a happy life without drugs. We suffer from fear and insanity and
feel that there is no escape from using. We may fear rejection
from our friends if we get clean. These feelings are common to
the addict seeking recovery. We could be suffering from an overly
sensitive ego. Some of the most common excuses for using are
loneliness, self-pity, and fear. Dishonesty, close-mindedness, and
unwillingness are three of our greatest enemies. Self-obsession is
the core of our disease.
   We have learned that old ideas and old ways won't help us to
stay clean or to live a better life. If we allow ourselves to stagnate
and cling to terminal hipness and fatal cool, we are giving into
the symptoms of our disease. One of the problems is that we
found it easier to change our perception of reality than to change
reality. We must give up this old concept and face the fact that
reality and life go on, whether we choose to accept them or not.
We can only change the way we react and the way we see our-
selves. This is necessary for us to accept that change is gradual
and recovery is an ongoing process.
   A meeting a day for at least the first ninety days of recovery
is a good idea. There is a special feeling for addicts when they

56 Narcotics Anonymous


   discover that there are other people who share their difficulties,
   past and present. At first we can do little more than attend meet-
   ings. Probably we cannot remember a single word, person or
   thought from our first meeting. In time, we can relax and enjoy
   the atmosphere of recovery. Meetings strengthen our recovery.
   We may be scared at first because we don't know anyone. Some
   of us think that we don't need meetings. However, when we
   hurt, we go to a meeting and find relief. Meetings keep us in
   touch with where we've been, but more importantly with where
   we could go in our recovery. As we go to meetings regularly, we
   learn the value of talking with other addicts who share our prob-
   lems and goals. We have to open up and accept the love and un-
   derstanding that we need in order to change. When we become
   acquainted with the Fellowship and its principles and begin to
   put them into action, we start to grow. We apply effort to our
   most obvious problems and let go of the rest. We do the job at
   hand, and as we progress, new opportunities for improvement
   present themselves.
      Our new friends in the Fellowship will help us. Our common
   effort is recovery. Clean, we face the world together. We no lon-
   ger have to feel backed into a corner, at the mercy of events and
   circumstances. It makes a difference to have friends who care
   if we hurt. We find our place in the Fellowship, and we join a
   group whose meetings help us in our recovery. We have been
   untrustworthy for so long that most of our friends and families
   will doubt our recovery. They think it won't last. We need people
   who understand our disease and the recovery process. At meet-
   ings we can share with other addicts, ask questions and learn
   about our disease. We learn new ways to live. We are no longer
   limited to our old ideas.
      Gradually, we replace old habits with new ways of living. We
   become willing to change. We go to meetings regularly, get and
   use telephone numbers, read literature, and most importantly,
   we don't use. We learn to share with others. If we don't tell some-

                                                    What Can I Do? 57



one we are hurting, they will seldom see it. When we reach out
for help, we can receive it.
   Another tool for the newcomer is involvement with the
Fellowship. As we become involved we learn to keep the pro-
gram first and take it easy in other matters. We begin by asking
for help and trying out the recommendations of people at the
meetings. It is beneficial to allow others in the group to help us.
In time, we will be able to pass on what we have been given.
We learn that service to others will get us out of ourselves. Our
work can begin with simple actions: emptying ashtrays, mak-
ing coffee, cleaning up, setting up for a meeting, opening the
door, chairing a meeting, and passing out literature. Doing these
things helps us feel a part of the Fellowship.
   We have found it helpful to have a sponsor and to use this
sponsor. Sponsorship is a two-way street. It helps both the
newcomer and the sponsor. The sponsor's clean time and ex-
perience may well depend on the availability of sponsors in a
locality. Sponsorship for newcomers is also the responsibility
of the group. It is implied and informal in its approach, but it is
the heart of the NA way of recovery from addiction--one addict
helping another.
   One of the most profound changes in our lives is in the realm of
personal relationships. Our earliest involvements with others often
begin with our sponsor.As newcomers, we find it easier if we have
someone whose judgement we trust and in whom we can confide.
We find that trusting others with more experience is a strength
rather than a weakness. Our experience reveals that working the
steps is our best guarantee against relapse. Our sponsors and
friends can advise us on how to work the steps. We can talk over
what the steps mean. They can help us to prepare for the spiritual
experience of living the steps. Asking God as we understand Him
for help improves our understanding of the steps. When we are
prepared, we must try out our newly found way of life. We learn
that the program won't work when we try to adapt it to our life. We
must learn to adapt our life to the program.

58 Narcotics Anonymous


      Today, we seek solutions, not problems. We try what we have
   learned on an experimental basis. We keep what we need and
   leave the rest. We find that by working the steps, communicating
   with our Higher Power, talking to our sponsors, and sharing
   with newcomers, we are able to grow spiritually.
      The Twelve Steps are used as a program of recovery. We learn
   that we can go to our Higher Power for help in solving problems.
   When we find ourselves sharing difficulties that used to have us
   on the run, we experience good feelings that give us the strength
   to begin seeking God's will for us.
      We believe that our Higher Power will take care of us. If we
   honestly try to do God's will, to the best of our ability, we can
   handle anything that happens. Seeking our Higher Power's will
   is a spiritual principle found in the steps. Working the steps and
   practicing the principles simplifies our lives and changes our old
   attitudes. When we admit that our lives have become unmanage-
   able, we don't have to argue our point of view. We have to ac-
   cept ourselves as we are. We no longer have to be right all the
   time. When we give ourselves this freedom, we can allow others
   to be wrong. Freedom to change seems to come after acceptance
   of ourselves.
      Sharing with fellow addicts is a basic tool in our program. This
   help can only come from another addict. It is this help that says,
   "I have had something like that happen to me, and I did this..."
   For anyone who wants our way of life, we share experience,
   strength, and hope instead of preaching and judging. If sharing
   the experience of our pain helps just one person, it was worth
   the suffering. We strengthen our own recovery when we share it
   with others who ask for help. If we keep what we have to share,
   we lose it. Words mean nothing until we put them into action.
      We recognize our spiritual growth when we are able to reach
   out and help others. We help others when we participate in ser-
   vice work and try to carry the message of recovery to the addict
   who still suffers. We learn that we keep what we have only by

                                                  What Can I Do? 59



giving it away. Also, our experience shows that many personal
problems are resolved when we get out of ourselves and offer to
help those in need. We recognize that one addict can best under-
stand and help another addict. No matter how much we give,
there is always another addict seeking help.
   We cannot afford to lose sight of the importance of sponsor-
ship and of taking a special interest in a confused addict who
wants to stop using. Experience shows clearly that those who
get the most out of the Narcotics Anonymous Program are those
to whom sponsorship is important. Sponsorship responsibilities
are welcomed by us and accepted as opportunities to enrich our
personal NA experience.
   Working with others is only the beginning of service work.
NA service allows us to spend much of our time directly help-
ing suffering addicts, as well as ensuring that Narcotics Anony-
mous itself survives. This way we keep what we have by giving
it away.

The Twelve Traditions
of Narcotics Anonymous

 We keep what we have only with vigilance, and just as freedom
 for the individual comes from the Twelve Steps, so freedom for
 the group springs from our Traditions.
   As long as the ties that bind us together are stronger than
 those that would tear us apart, all will be well.

   1.   Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery
        depends on NA unity.

   2.   For our group purpose there is but one ultimate
        authority--a loving God as He may express Himself
        in our group conscience. Our leaders are but trusted
        servants; they do not govern.

   3.   The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop
        using.

   4.   Each group should be autonomous except in matters
        affecting other groups or NA as a whole.

   5.   Each group has but one primary purpose--to carry the
        message to the addict who still suffers.

   6.   An NA group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the
        NA name to any related facility or outside enterprise, lest
        problems of money, property or prestige divert us from our
        primary purpose.

   7.   Every NA group ought to be fully self-supporting,
        declining outside contributions.

   8.   Narcotics Anonymous should remain forever
        nonprofessional, but our service centers may employ
        special workers.

                               60

                        The Twelve Traditions of Narcotics Anonymous 61


      9. NA, as such, ought never be organized, but we may create
         service boards or committees directly responsible to those
         they serve.

    10.  Narcotics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues;
         hence the NA name ought never be drawn into
         public controversy.

    11.  Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather
         than promotion; we need always maintain personal
         anonymity at the level of press, radio, and films.

    12.  Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our
         Traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before
         personalities.

Understanding     these Traditions comes slowly over a period of
time. We pick up information as we talk to members and visit
various groups. It usually isn't until we get involved with service
that someone points out that "personal recovery depends on NA
unity," and that unity depends on how well we follow our Tradi-
tions. The Twelve Traditions of NA are not negotiable. They are
the guidelines that keep our Fellowship alive and free.
   By following these guidelines in our dealings with others, and
society at large, we avoid many problems. That is not to say that
our Traditions eliminate all problems. We still have to face dif-
ficulties as they arise: communication problems, differences of
opinion, internal controversies, and troubles with individuals
and groups outside the Fellowship. However, when we apply
these principles, we avoid some of the pitfalls.
   Many of our problems are like those that our predecessors had
to face. Their hard won experience gave birth to the Traditions,
and our own experience has shown that these principles are just
as valid today as they were when these Traditions were formulat-
ed. Our Traditions protect us from the internal and external forces
that could destroy us. They are truly the ties that bind us together.
It is only through understanding and application that they work.

62 Narcotics Anonymous


   Tradition One
     "Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery
     depends on NA unity."

   Our   First Tradition concerns unity and our common welfare.
   One of the most important things about our new way of life is be-
   ing a part of a group of addicts seeking recovery. Our survival is
   directly related to the survival of the group and the Fellowship.
   To maintain unity within Narcotics Anonymous, it is imperative
   that the group remain stable, or the entire Fellowship perishes
   and the individual dies.
     It wasn't until we came to Narcotics Anonymous that recov-
   ery became possible. This program can do for us what we could
   not do for ourselves. We became part of a group and found that
   we could recover. We learned that those who did not continue
   to be an active part of the Fellowship faced a rough road. The
   individual is precious to the group, and the group is precious to
   the individual. We never experienced the kind of attention and
   personal care that we found in the program. We are accepted
   and loved for who we are, not in spite of who we are. No one can
   revoke our membership or make us do anything that we do not
   choose to do. We follow this way of life by example rather than
   direction. We share our experience and learn from each other. In
   our addiction, we consistently placed our personal desires be-
   fore anything else. In Narcotics Anonymous we find that what is
   best for the group is usually good for us.
     Our personal experiences while using differed from one
   another. As a group, however, we have found many common
   themes in our addiction. One of these was the need to prove self-
   sufficiency. We had convinced ourselves that we could make it
   alone and proceeded to live life on that basis. The results were
   disastrous and, in the end, each of us had to admit that self-
   sufficiency was a lie. This admission was the starting point of our
   recovery and is a primary point of unity for the Fellowship. We

                       The Twelve Traditions of Narcotics Anonymous 63


had common themes in our addiction, and we find that in our
recovery we have much in common. We share a common desire
to stay clean. We have learned to depend on a Power greater than
ourselves. Our purpose is to carry the message to the addict who
still suffers. Our Traditions are the guidelines that protect us
from ourselves. They are our unity.
   Unity is a must in NarcoticsAnonymous. This is not to say that
we do not have our disagreements and conflicts; we do. When-
ever people get together there are differences of opinions. How-
ever, we can disagree without being disagreeable. Time and time
again, in crises we have set aside our differences and worked for
the common good. We have seen two members, who usually do
not get along, work together with a newcomer. We have seen a
group doing menial tasks to pay rent for their meeting hall. We
have seen members drive hundreds of miles to help support a
new group. These activities and many others are commonplace in
our Fellowship. Without these actions NA could not survive.
   We must live and work together as a group to ensure that in
a storm our ship does not sink and our members do not perish.
With faith in a Power greater than ourselves, hard work, and
unity we will survive and continue to carry the message to the
addict who still suffers.


Tradition Two
   "For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority--
   a loving God as He may express Himself in our group
   conscience. Our leaders are but trusted servants; they do
   not govern."

In  Narcotics Anonymous, we are concerned with protecting
ourselves from ourselves. Our Second Tradition is an example of
this. By nature, we are strong-willed, self-centered people, who
are thrust together in NA. We are mismanagers and not one of us
is capable of consistently making good decisions.

64 Narcotics Anonymous


      In Narcotics Anonymous, we rely on a loving God as He ex-
   presses Himself in our group conscience, rather than on personal
   opinion or ego. By working the steps, we learn to depend on a
   Powergreaterthanourselves,andtousethisPowerforourgroup
   purposes. We must be constantly on guard that our decisions are
   truly an expression of God's will. There is often a vast difference
   between group conscience and group opinion, as dictated by
   powerful personalities or popularity. Some of our most painful
   growing experiences have come as a result of decisions made in
   the name of group conscience. True spiritual principles are never
   in conflict; they complement each other. The spiritual conscience
   of a group will never contradict any of our Traditions.
      The Second Tradition concerns the nature of leadership in NA.
   We have learned that for our Fellowship, leadership by example
   and by selfless service works. Direction and manipulation fail.
   We choose not to have presidents, masters, or directors. Instead
   we have secretaries, treasurers and representatives. These titles
   imply service rather than control. Our experience shows that if
   a group becomes an extension of the personality of a leader or
   member, it loses its effectiveness. An atmosphere of recovery in
   our groups is one of our most valued assets, and we must guard
   it carefully, lest we lose it to politics and personalities.
      Those of us who have been involved in service or in getting a
   group started sometimes have a hard time letting go. Egos, un-
   founded pride, and self-will destroy a group if given authority.
   We must remember that offices have been placed in trust, that
   we are trusted servants, and that at no time do any of us gov-
   ern. Narcotics Anonymous is a God-given program, and we can
   maintain our group in dignity only with group conscience and
   God's love.
      Some will resist. However, many will become the role models
   for the newcomers. The self-seekers soon find that they are on
   the outside, causing dissension and eventually disaster for them-
   selves. Many of them change; they learn that we can only be gov-
   erned by a loving God as expressed in our group conscience.

                        The Twelve Traditions of Narcotics Anonymous 65


Tradition Three
   "The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop using."

This   tradition is important for both the individual and the
group. Desire is the key word; desire is the basis of our recovery.
In our stories and in our experience of trying to carry the mes-
sage of recovery to the addict who still suffers, one painful fact of
life has emerged again and again. An addict who does not want
to stop using will not stop using. They can be analyzed, coun-
seled, reasoned with, prayed over, threatened, beaten, or locked
up, but they will not stop until they want to stop. The only thing
we ask of our members is that they have this desire. Without it
they are doomed, but with it miracles will happen.
   Desire is our only requirement. Addiction does not discrimi-
nate. This tradition is to ensure that any addict, regardless of
drugs used, race, religious beliefs, sex, sexual preference, or
financial condition is free to practice the NA way of life. With
"... a desire to stop using" as the only requirement for member-
ship, one addict is never superior to another. All addicted per-
sons are welcome and equal in obtaining the relief that they are
seeking from their addiction; every addict can recover in this pro-
gram on an equal basis. This tradition guarantees our freedom to
recover.
   Membership in Narcotics Anonymous is not automatic when
someone walks in the door or when the newcomer decides to
stop using. The decision to become a part of our Fellowship rests
with the individual. Any addict who has a desire to stop using
can become a member of NA. We are addicts, and our problem
is addiction.
   The choice of membership rests with the individual. We feel
that the ideal state for our Fellowship exists when addicts can
come freely and openly to an NA meeting, whenever and wher-
ever they choose, and leave just as freely. We realize that recov-
ery is a reality and that life without drugs is better than we ever

66 Narcotics Anonymous


   imagined. We open our doors to other addicts, hoping that they
   can find what we have found. But we know that only those who
   have a desire to stop using and want what we have to offer will
   join us in our way of life.


   Tradition Four
     "Each group should be autonomous except in matters
     affecting other groups or NA as a whole."

   The   autonomy of our groups is necessary for our survival. A
   dictionary defines autonomous as "having the right or power
   of self-government...undertaken or carried on without outside
   control." This means our groups are self-governing, and not sub-
   ject to outside control. Every group has had to stand and grow
   on its own.
     One might ask, "Are we truly autonomous? Don't we have
   service committees, offices, activities, hot lines, and other activi-
   ties in NA?" They are services we use to help us in our recovery
   and to further the primary purpose of our groups. Narcotics
   Anonymous is a Fellowship of men and women, addicts meet-
   ing in groups and using a given set of spiritual principles to find
   freedom from addiction and a new way to live. The services that
   we mentioned are the result of members who care enough to
   reach out and offer help and experience so that our road might
   be easier.
     A Narcotics Anonymous group is any group that meets regu-
   larly, at a specified place and time, for the purpose of recovery,
   provided that it follows the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions
   of Narcotics Anonymous. There are two basic types of meetings:
   those open to the general public and those closed to the public
   (for addicts only). Meeting formats vary widely from group to
   group; some are participation meetings, some speakers, some
   are question and answer, and some focus on special problems
   discussion.

                       The Twelve Traditions of Narcotics Anonymous 67


   Whatever the type or format a group uses for its meetings, the
function of a group is always the same; to provide a suitable and
reliable environment for personal recovery and to promote such
recovery. These Traditions are part of a set of spiritual principles
of Narcotics Anonymous, and without them NA does not exist.
   Autonomy gives our groups the freedom to act on their own
to establish an atmosphere of recovery, serve their members and
fulfill their primary purpose. It is for these reasons that we guard
our autonomy so carefully.
   It would seem that we, in our groups, can do whatever we
decide, regardless of what anyone says. This is partly true. Each
group does have complete freedom, except when their actions
affect other groups or NA as a whole. Like group conscience,
autonomy can be a two-edged sword. Group autonomy has been
used to justify violation of the Traditions. If a contradiction ex-
ists, we have slipped away from our principles. If we check to
make sure that our actions are clearly within the bounds of our
traditions; if we do not dictate to other groups, or force anything
upon them; and if we consider the consequences of our action
ahead of time, then all will be well.


Tradition Five
   "Each group has but one primary purpose--to carry the
   message to the addict who still suffers."

"You     mean to say that our primary purpose is to carry the
message? I thought we were here to get clean. I thought that
our primary purpose was to recover from drug addiction." For
the individual, this is certainly true; our members are here to
find freedom from addiction and a new way of life. However,
groups aren't addicted and don't recover. All our groups can do
is plant the seed for recovery and bring addicts together so that
the magic of empathy, honesty, caring, sharing, and service can
do their work. The purpose of this tradition is to ensure that this

68 Narcotics Anonymous


   atmosphere of recovery is maintained. This can only be achieved
   by keeping our groups recovery-oriented. The fact that we, each
   and every group, focus on carrying the message provides con-
   sistency; addicts can count on us. Unity of action and purpose
   makes possible what seemed impossible for us--recovery.
     The Twelfth Step of our personal program also says that we
   carry the message to the addict who still suffers. Working with
   others is a powerful tool. "The therapeutic value of one addict
   helping another is without parallel." For the newcomers, this is
   how they found Narcotics Anonymous and learned to stay clean.
   For the members, this reaffirms their commitment to recovery.
   The group is the most powerful vehicle we have for carrying the
   message. When a member carries the message, he is somewhat
   bound by interpretation and personality. The problem with lit-
   erature is language. The feelings, the intensity, and the strengths
   are sometimes lost. In our group, with many different personali-
   ties, the message of recovery is a recurring theme.
     What would happen if our groups had another primary pur-
   pose? We feel our message would be diluted and then lost. If we
   concentrated on making money, many might get rich. If we were
   a social club, we could find many friends and lovers. If we spe-
   cialized in education, we'd end up with many smart addicts. If
   our specialty was medical help, many would get healthy. If our
   group purpose were anything other than to carry the message,
   many would die and few would find recovery.
     What is our message? The message is that an addict, any ad-
   dict, can stop using drugs, lose the desire to use, and find a new
   way to live. Our message is hope and the promise of freedom.
   When all is said and done, our primary purpose can only be to
   carry the message to the addict who still suffers because that is
   all we have to give.

                        The Twelve Traditions of Narcotics Anonymous 69


Tradition Six
  "An NA group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the
  NA name to any related facility or outside enterprise, lest
  problems of money, property or prestige divert us from our
  primary purpose."

Our   Sixth Tradition tells us some of the things that we must do
to preserve and protect our primary purpose. This tradition is
the basis for our policy of non-affiliation and is extremely impor-
tant to the continuation and growth of Narcotics Anonymous.
  Let's take a look at what this tradition says. The first thing
a group ought never do is endorse. To endorse is to sanction,
approve or recommend. Endorsements can be either direct or
implied. We see direct endorsements every day in television
commercials. An implied endorsement is one that is not specifi-
cally stated.
  Many other organizations wish to ride on the NA name. To
allow them to do so would be an implied endorsement and a
violation of this tradition. Hospitals, drug recovery houses, pro-
bation and parole offices are some of the facilities we deal with in
carrying the NA message. While these organizations are sincere
and we hold NAmeetings in their establishments, we cannot en-
dorse, finance or allow them to use the NA name to further their
growth. However, we are willing to carry the NA principles into
these institutions, to the addicts who still suffer so that they can
make the choice.
  The next thing we ought never do is finance. This is more
obvious. To finance means to supply funds or to help support
financially.
  The third thing warned against in this tradition is lending the
NAname to fulfill the purposes of other programs. For example,
several times other programs have tried to use Narcotics Anony-
mous as part of their services offered, to help justify funding.

70 Narcotics Anonymous


      Further the tradition tells us that a related facility is any place
   involving NA members. It might be a halfway house, a detox
   center, a counseling center, or a clubhouse. People are easily
   confused by what is NA and what are the related facilities. Re-
   covery houses that have been started or staffed by NA members
   have to take care that the differentiation is clear. Perhaps the
   most confusion exists when it involves a clubhouse. Newcom-
   ers and older members often identify the clubhouse with Nar-
   cotics Anonymous. We should make a special effort to let these
   people know that these facilities and NA are not the same. An
   outside enterprise is any agency, business venture, religion, soci-
   ety, organization, related activity, or any other fellowship. Most
   of these are easy to identify, except for the other fellowships.
   Narcotics Anonymous is a separate and distinct fellowship in
   its own right. Our problem is addiction. The other Twelve Step
   Fellowships specialize in other problems, and our relationship
   with them is one of cooperation, not affiliation. The use of lit-
   erature, speakers, and announcements from other fellowships in
   our meetings constitutes an implied endorsement of an outside
   enterprise.
      The Sixth Tradition goes on to warn us what may happen:
   "lest problems of money, property or prestige divert us from our
   primary purpose." These problems often become obsessions and
   shut us off from our spiritual aim. For the individual, this type
   of abuse can be devastating; for the group, it can be disastrous.
   When we, as a group, waiver from our primary purpose, addicts
   who might have found recovery die.


   Tradition Seven
      "Every NA group ought to be fully self-supporting,
      declining outside contributions."

   Being   self-supporting is an important part of our new way of
   life. For the individual, this is usually quite a change. In our

                          The Twelve Traditions of Narcotics Anonymous 71


addiction, we were dependent on people, places, and things.
We looked to them to support us and supply the things that we
found lacking in ourselves. As recovering addicts, we find that
we are still dependent, but our dependence has shifted from the
things around us to a loving God and the inner strength we get in
our relationship with Him. We, who were unable to function as
human beings, now find that anything is possible of us. Dreams
that we gave up long ago can now become realities. Addicts as a
group have been a burden to society. In NA, our groups not only
stand on their own, but demand the right to do so.
  Money has always been a problem for us. We could never find
enough to support ourselves and our habits. We worked, stole,
conned, begged and sold ourselves; there was never enough
money to fill the emptiness inside. In our recovery, money is of-
ten still a problem.
  We need money to run our group; there is rent to pay, sup-
plies and literature to buy. We take a collection in our meetings
to cover these expenses and whatever is left goes to support our
services and to further our primary purpose. Unfortunately,
there is little left once a group pays its way. Sometimes members
who can afford it give a little extra to help. Sometimes a commit-
tee is formed to put on an activity to raise funds. These efforts
help and without them, we could not have come this far. NAser-
vices remain in need of money, and even though it is sometimes
frustrating, we really would not have it any other way; we know
the price would be too high. We all have to pull together, and in
pulling together we learn that we really are part of something
greater than ourselves.
  Our policy concerning money is clearly stated: We decline
any outside contributions; our Fellowship is completely self-
supporting. We accept no funding, endowments, loans, and/or
gifts. Everything has its price, regardless of intent. Whether
the price is money, promises, concessions, special recognition,
endorsements, or favors, it's too high for us. Even if those who

72 Narcotics Anonymous


   would help us could guarantee no strings, we still would not ac-
   cept their aid. We cannot afford to let our members contribute
   more than their fair share. We have found that the price paid
   by our groups is disunity and controversy. We will not put our
   freedom on the line.

   Tradition Eight
      "Narcotics Anonymous should remain forever nonprofessional,
      but our service centers may employ special workers."

   The   Eighth Tradition is vital to the stability of NA as a whole.
   In order to understand this tradition we need to define
   "nonprofessional service centers" and "special workers." With
   an understanding of these terms, this important tradition is self-
   explanatory.
      In this tradition we say that we have no professionals. By this,
   we mean we have no staff psychiatrists, doctors, lawyers, or
   counselors. Our program works by one addict helping another.
   If we employed professionals in NA groups, we would destroy
   our unity. We are simply addicts of equal status freely helping
   one another.
      We recognize and admire the professionals. Many of our
   members are professionals in their own right, but there is no
   room for professionalism in NA.
      A service center is defined as a place where NA service com-
   mittees operate. The World Service Office or local, regional, and
   area offices are examples of service centers. A clubhouse or half-
   way house, or similar facility, is not an NA service center and is
   not affiliated with NA. A service center is, very simply, a place
   where NA services are offered on a continuing basis.
      The tradition states, "Service centers may employ special
   workers." This statement means that service centers may em-
   ploy workers for special skills such as phone answering, clerical
   work, or printing. Such employees are directly responsible to a
   service committee. As NA grows, the demand for these workers

                       The Twelve Traditions of Narcotics Anonymous 73


will grow. Special workers are necessary to ensure efficiency in
an ever-expanding fellowship.
  The difference between professionals and special workers
should be defined for clarity. Professionals work in specific pro-
fessions that do not directly service NA, but are for personal gain.
Professionals do not follow the NA Traditions. Our special work-
ers, on the other hand, work within our Traditions and are always
directly responsible to those they serve, to the Fellowship.
  In our Eighth Tradition, we do not single out our members as
professional. By not placing professional status on any member,
we ensure that we remain "forever nonprofessional."


Tradition Nine
  "NA, as such, ought never be organized, but we may create
  service boards or committees directly responsible to those they
  serve."

This  tradition defines the way that our Fellowship functions.
We must first understand what NA is. Narcotics Anonymous is
addicts who have the desire to stop using, and have joined to-
gether to do so. Our meetings are a gathering of members for the
purpose of staying clean and carrying the message of recovery.
Our steps and traditions are set down in a specific order. They
are numbered, they are not random and unstructured. They are
organized, but this is not the type of organization referred to in
the Ninth Tradition. In this tradition, "organized" means having
management and control. On this basis, the meaning of Tradition
Nine is clear. Without this tradition, our Fellowship would be in
opposition to spiritual principles. A loving God, as He may ex-
press Himself in our group conscience, is our ultimate authority.
  The Ninth Tradition goes on to define the nature of the things
that we can do to help NA. It says that we may create service
boards or committees to serve the needs of the Fellowship. They
exist solely to serve the Fellowship. This is the nature of our

74 Narcotics Anonymous


   service structure as it has evolved and been defined in the NA
   service manual.


   Tradition Ten
     "Narcotics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence
     the NA name ought never be drawn into public controversy."

   In order to achieve our spiritual aim, NarcoticsAnonymous must
   be known and respected. Nowhere is this more obvious than in
   our history. NA was founded in 1953. For twenty years, our
   Fellowship remained small and obscure. In the 1970's, society re-
   alized that addiction had become a worldwide epidemic and be-
   gan to look for answers. Along with this came change in the way
   people thought of the addict. This change allowed addicts to seek
   help more openly. NA groups sprang up in many places where
   we were never tolerated before. Recovering addicts paved the
   way for more groups and more recovery. Today NA is a world-
   wide Fellowship. We are known and respected everywhere.
     If an addict has never heard of us, he cannot seek us out. If
   those who work with addicts are unaware of our existence, they
   cannot refer them to us. One of the most important things we can
   do to further our primary purpose is to let people know who,
   what and where we are. If we do this and keep our good reputa-
   tion, we will surely grow.
     Our recovery speaks for itself. Our Tenth Tradition specifically
   helps protect our reputation. This tradition says that NA has no
   opinion on outside issues. We don't take sides. We don't have
   any recommendations. NA, as a Fellowship, does not participate
   in politics; to do so would invite controversy. It would jeopardize
   our Fellowship. Those who agree with our opinions might com-
   mend us for taking a stand, but some would always disagree.
   With a price this high, is it any wonder we choose not to take
   sides in society's problems? For our own survival, we have no
   opinion on outside issues.

                         The Twelve Traditions of Narcotics Anonymous 75


Tradition Eleven
   "Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than
   promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at
   the level of press, radio, and films."

This   tradition deals with our relationship to those outside the
Fellowship. It tells us how to conduct our efforts at the public
level. Our public image consists of what we have to offer, a suc-
cessful proven way of maintaining a drug-free lifestyle. While it
is important to reach as many people as possible, it is imperative
for our protection that we are careful about advertisements, cir-
culars and any literature that may reach the public's hands.
   Our attraction is that we are successes in our own right. As
groups, we offer recovery. We have found that the success of our
program speaks for itself; this is our promotion.
   This tradition goes on to tell us that we need to maintain per-
sonal anonymity at the level of press, radio, and films. This is to
protect the membership and the reputation of Narcotics Anony-
mous. We do not give our last names nor appear in the media
as a member of Narcotics Anonymous. No individual inside or
outside the Fellowship represents Narcotics Anonymous.


Tradition Twelve
   "Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our Traditions,
   ever reminding us to place principles before personalities."

A   dictionary definition of anonymity is "a state of bearing no
name." In keeping with Tradition Twelve, the "I" becomes "we."
The spiritual foundation becomes more important than any one
group or individual.
   As we find ourselves growing closer together, the awakening
of humility occurs. Humility is a by-product that allows us to
grow and develop in an atmosphere of freedom, and removes

76 Narcotics Anonymous


   the fear of becoming known by our employers, families or
   friends as addicts. Therefore, we attempt to rigorously adhere to
   the principle that "what is said in meetings stays in meetings."
      Throughout our Traditions, we speak in terms of "we" and
   "our" rather than "me" and "mine." By working together for our
   common welfare, we achieve the true spirit of anonymity.
      We have heard the phrase "principles before personalities" so
   often that it is like a cliche. While we may disagree as individu-
   als, the spiritual principle of anonymity makes us all equal as
   members of the group. No member is greater or lesser than any
   other member. The drive for personal gain in the areas of sex,
   property and social position, which brought so much pain in the
   past, falls by the wayside if we adhere to the principle of ano-
   nymity. Anonymity is one of the basic elements of our recovery
   and it pervades our Traditions and our Fellowship. It protects
   us from our own defects of character and renders personalities
   and their differences powerless. Anonymity in action makes it
   impossible for personalities to come before principles.

Recovery and Relapse

Many people think that recovery is simply a matter of not
using drugs. They consider a relapse a sign of complete failure,
and long periods of abstinence a sign of complete success. We
in the recovery program of Narcotics Anonymous have found
that this perception is too simplistic. After a member has had
some involvement in our Fellowship, a relapse may be the
jarring experience that brings about a more rigorous application
of the program. By the same token we have observed some
members who remain abstinent for long periods of time whose
dishonesty and self-deceit still prevent them from enjoying
complete recovery and acceptance within society. Complete
and continuous abstinence, however, in close association and
identification with others in NA groups, is still the best ground
for growth.
   Although all addicts are basically the same in kind, we do,
as individuals, differ in degree of sickness and rate of recovery.
There may be times when a relapse lays the groundwork for
complete freedom. At other times that freedom can only be
achieved by a grim and obstinate willfulness to hang on to
abstinence come hell or high water until a crisis passes. An
addict, who by any means can lose, even for a time, the need or
desire to use, and has free choice over impulsive thinking and
compulsive action, has reached a turning point that may be the
decisive factor in his recovery. The feeling of true independence
and freedom hangs here at times in the balance. To step out alone
and run our own lives again draws us, yet we seem to know that
what we have has come from dependence on a Power greater




                                 77

78 Narcotics Anonymous


     than ourselves and from the giving and receiving of help from
     others in acts of empathy. Many times in our recovery the old
     bugaboos will haunt us. Life may again become meaningless,
     monotonous and boring. We may tire mentally in repeating
     our new ideas and tire physically in our new activities, yet we
     know that if we fail to repeat them we will surely take up our
     old practices. We suspect that if we do not use what we have, we
     will lose what we have. These times are often the periods of our
     greatest growth. Our minds and bodies seem tired of it all, yet
     the dynamic forces of change or true conversion, deep within,
     may be working to give us the answers that alter our inner
     motivations and change our lives.
        Recovery as experienced through our Twelve Steps is our
     goal, not mere physical abstinence. To improve ourselves takes
     effort, and since there is no way in the world to graft a new idea
     on a closed mind, an opening must be made somehow. Since we
     can do this only for ourselves, we need to recognize two of our
     seemingly inherent enemies, apathy and procrastination. Our
     resistance to change seems built in, and only a nuclear blast of
     some kind will bring about any alteration or initiate another
     course of action. A relapse, if we survive it, may provide the
     charge for the demolition process. A relapse and sometimes
     subsequent death of someone close to us can do the job of
     awakening us to the necessity for vigorous personal action.

   We   have seen addicts come to our Fellowship, try our program
   and stay clean for a period of time. Over time some addicts lost
   contact with other recovering addicts and eventually returned
   to active addiction. They forgot that it is really the first drug that
   starts the deadly cycle all over again. They tried to control it, to
   use in moderation, or to use just certain drugs. None of these
   control methods work for addicts.
     Relapse is a reality. It can and does happen. Experience shows
   that those who do not work our program of recovery on a daily

                                                 Recovery and Relapse 79


basis may relapse. We see them come back seeking recovery.
Maybe they were clean for years before their relapse. If they are
lucky enough to make it back, they are shaken badly. They tell
us that the relapse was more horrible than earlier use. We have
never seen a person who lives the Narcotics Anonymous Pro-
gram relapse.
   Relapses are often fatal. We have attended funerals of loved
ones who died from a relapse. They died in various ways. Often
we see relapsers lost for years, living in misery. Those who make
it to jail or institutions may survive and perhaps have a reintro-
duction to NA.
   In our daily lives, we are subject to emotional and spiritual
lapses, causing us to become defenseless against the physical
relapse of drug use. Because addiction is an incurable disease,
addicts are subject to relapse.
   We are never forced into relapse. We are given a choice. Re-
lapse is never an accident. Relapse is a sign that we have a res-
ervation in our program. We begin to slight our program and
leave loopholes in our daily lives. Unaware of the pitfalls ahead,
we stumble blindly in the belief that we can make it on our own.
Sooner or later we fall into the illusions that drugs make life
easier. We believe that drugs can change us, and we forget that
these changes are lethal. When we believe that drugs will solve
our problems and forget what they can do to us, we are in real
trouble. Unless the illusions that we can continue to use or stop
using on our own are shattered, we most certainly sign our own
death warrant. For some reason, not taking care of our personal
affairs lowers our self-esteem and establishes a pattern that re-
peats itself in all areas of our lives. If we begin to avoid our new
responsibilities by missing meetings, neglecting Twelfth Step
work, or not getting involved, our program stops. These are the
kinds of things that lead to relapse. We may sense a change com-
ing over us. Our ability to remain open-minded disappears. We
may become angry and resentful toward anyone or anything.

80 Narcotics Anonymous


   We may begin to reject those who were close to us. We isolate
   ourselves. We become sick of ourselves in a short time. We re-
   vert back to our sickest behavior patterns without even having
   to use drugs.
     When a resentment or any other emotional upheaval occurs,
   failure to practice the steps can result in a relapse.
     Obsessive behavior is a common denominator for addictive
   people. We have times when we try to fill ourselves up until we
   are satisfied, only to discover that there is no way to satisfy us.
   Part of our addictive pattern is that we can never get enough.
   Sometimes we forget, and we think that if we can just get enough
   food or enough sex, or enough money we'll be satisfied, and
   everything will be all right. Self-will still leads us to make deci-
   sions based on manipulation, ego, lust or false pride. We don't
   like to be wrong. Our egos tell us that we can do it on our own,
   but loneliness and paranoia quickly return. We find that we can-
   not really do it alone; when we try, things get worse. We need
   to be reminded of where we came from and that our disease
   will get progressively worse if we use. This is when we need the
   Fellowship.
     We don't recover overnight. When we realize that we have
   made a bad decision or bad judgment, our inclination is to ration-
   alize it. We often become extreme in our self-obsessive attempt
   to cover our tracks. We forget that we have a choice today. We
   get sicker.
     There is something in our self-destructive personalities that
   cries for failure. Most of us feel that we do not deserve to suc-
   ceed. This is a common theme with addicts. Self-pity is one of the
   most destructive of defects; it will drain us of all positive energy.
   We focus on anything that isn't going our way and ignore all the
   beauty in our lives. With no real desire to improve our lives, or
   even to live, we just keep going further and further down. Some
   of us never make it back.

                                                Recovery and Relapse 81


  We must relearn many things that we have forgotten and de-
velop a new approach to life if we are to survive. This is what
Narcotics Anonymous is all about. It is about people who care
about desperate, dying addicts and who can, in time, teach them
how to live without drugs. Many of us had difficulty coming into
the Fellowship, because we did not understand that we have the
disease of addiction. We sometimes see our past behavior as part
of ourselves and not part of our disease.
  We take the First Step. We admit that we are powerless over
our addiction, that our lives have become unmanageable. Slowly
things get better, and we start getting our confidence back. Our
ego tells us that we can do it on our own. Things are getting bet-
ter, and we think we really don't need this program. Cockiness is
a red light indicator. The loneliness and paranoia will come back.
We find out that we can't do it on our own and things get worse.
We really take the First Step, this time internally. There will be
times, however, when we really feel like using. We want to run,
and we feel lousy. We need to be reminded of where we came
from and that it will be worse this time. This is when we need the
program the most. We realize we must do something.
  When we forget the effort and the work that it took us to get
a period of freedom in our lives, a lack of gratitude sinks in, and
self-destruction begins again. Unless action is taken immediately,
we run the risk of a relapse that threatens our very existence.
Keeping our illusion of reality, rather than using the tools of the
program, will return us to isolation. Loneliness will kill us inside
and the drugs that almost always come next may do the job com-
pletely. The symptoms and the feelings that we experienced at
the end of our using will come back even stronger than before.
This impact is sure to destroy us if we don't surrender ourselves
to the NA Program.
  Relapse can be the destructive force that kills us or leads us
to the realization of who and what we really are. The eventual

82 Narcotics Anonymous


   misery of using is not worth the temporary escape it might give
   us. For us, to use is to die, often in more ways than one.
      One of the biggest stumbling blocks to recovery seems to
   be placing unrealistic expectations on ourselves or others. Re-
   lationships can be a terribly painful area. We tend to fantasize
   and project what will happen. We get angry and resentful if our
   fantasies are not fulfilled. We forget that we are powerless over
   other people. The old thoughts and feelings of loneliness, de-
   spair, helplessness and self-pity creep in. Thoughts of sponsors,
   meetings, literature and all other positive input leave our con-
   sciousness. We have to keep our recovery first and our priorities
   in order.
      Writing about what we want, what we are asking for, what we
   get, and sharing this with our sponsor or another trusted person
   helps us to work through negative feelings. Letting others share
   their experience with us gives us hope that it does get better. It
   seems that being powerless is a huge stumbling block. When
   a need arises for us to admit our powerlessness, we may first
   look for ways to exert power against it. After exhausting these
   ways, we begin sharing with others, and we find hope. Attend-
   ing meetings daily, living a day at a time, and reading literature
   seems to send our mental attitude back toward the positive. Will-
   ingness to try what has worked for others is vital. Even when
   we feel that we don't want to attend, meetings are a source of
   strength and hope for us.
      It is important to share our feelings of wanting to use drugs.
   It is amazing how often newcomers think that it is really abnor-
   mal for a drug addict to want to use. When we feel the old urges
   come over us, we think there must be something wrong with us,
   and that other people in NarcoticsAnonymous couldn't possibly
   understand.
      It is important to remember that the desire to use will pass. We
   never have to use again, no matter how we feel. All feelings will
   eventually pass.

                                                Recovery and Relapse 83


  The progression of recovery is a continuous, uphill journey.
Without effort we start the downhill run again. The progression
of the disease is an ongoing process, even during abstinence.
  We come here powerless, and the power that we seek comes
to us through other people in Narcotics Anonymous, but we
must reach out for it. Now clean and in the Fellowship, we need
to keep ourselves surrounded by others who know us well. We
need each other. Narcotics Anonymous is a Fellowship of sur-
vival, and one of its advantages is that it places us in intimate,
regular contact with the very people who can best understand
and help us in our recovery. Good ideas and good intentions do
not help if we fail to put them into action. Reaching out is the
beginning of the struggle that will set us free. It will break down
the walls that imprison us. A symptom of our disease is alien-
ation, and honest sharing will free us to recover.
  We are grateful that we were made so welcome at meetings
that we felt comfortable. Without staying clean and coming to
those meetings, we would surely have a rougher time with the
steps. Any use of drugs will interrupt the process of recovery.
  We all find that the feeling we get from helping others moti-
vates us to do better in our own lives. If we are hurting, and most
of us do from time to time, we learn to ask for help. We find that
pain shared is pain lessened. Members of the Fellowship are
willing to help a relapser recover and have insight and useful
suggestions to offer when asked. Recovery found in Narcotics
Anonymous must come from within, and no one stays clean for
anyone but themselves.
  In our disease, we are dealing with a destructive, violent
power greater than ourselves that can lead to relapse. If we have
relapsed, it is important to keep in mind that we must get back
to meetings as soon as possible. Otherwise, we may have only
months, days, or hours before we reach a threshold where we
are gone beyond recall. Our disease is so cunning that it can get
us into impossible situations. When it does, we come back to the

84 Narcotics Anonymous


   program if we can, while we can. Once we use, we are under the
   control of our disease.
     We can never fully recover, no matter how long we stay clean.
   Complacency is the enemy of members with substantial clean
   time. If we remain complacent for long, the recovery process
   ceases. The disease will manifest apparent symptoms in us.
   Denial returns, along with obsession and compulsion. Guilt, re-
   morse, fear, and pride may become unbearable. Soon we reach a
   place where our backs are against the wall. Denial and the First
   Step conflict in our minds. If we let the obsession of using over-
   come us, we are doomed. Only a complete and total acceptance
   of the First Step can save us. We must totally surrender ourselves
   to the program.
     The first thing to do is to stay clean. This makes the other
   stages of recovery possible. As long as we stay clean, no matter
   what, we have the greatest possible advantage over our disease.
   For this we are grateful.
     Many of us get clean in a protected environment, such as a
   rehabilitation center or recovery house. When we re-enter the
   world, we feel lost, confused and vulnerable. Going to meetings
   as often as possible will reduce the shock of change. Meetings
   provide a safe place to share with others. We begin to live the pro-
   gram; we learn to apply spiritual principles in our lives. We must
   use what we learn or we will lose it in a relapse.
     Many of us would have had nowhere else to go, if we could
   not have trusted NAgroups and members.At first, we were both
   captivated and intimidated by the fellowship. No longer com-
   fortable with our using friends, we were not yet at home in the
   meetings. We began to lose our fear through the experience of
   sharing. The more we shared, the more our fears slipped away.
   We shared for this reason. Growth means change. Spiritual
   maintenance means ongoing recovery. Isolation is dangerous to
   spiritual growth.

  Those of us who find the Fellowship and begin to live the
steps develop relationships with others. As we grow, we learn to
overcome the tendency to run and hide from ourselves and our
feelings. Being honest about our feelings helps others to identify
with us. We find that when we communicate honestly, we reach
others. Honesty takes practice, and none of us claims to be per-
fect. When we feel trapped or pressured, it takes great spiritual
and emotional strength to be honest. Sharing with others keeps
us from feeling isolated and alone. This process is a creative ac-
tion of the spirit.
  When we work the program, we are living the steps daily. This
gives us experience in applying spiritual principles. The expe-
rience that we gain with time helps our ongoing recovery. We
must use what we learn or we will lose it, no matter how long
we have been clean. Eventually we are shown that we must get
honest, or we will use again. We pray for willingness and humil-
ity and finally get honest about our mistaken judgments or bad
decisions. We tell those we have harmed that we were to blame
and make whatever amends are necessary. Now we are in the
solution again. We are working the program. It becomes easier
to work the program now. We know that the steps help prevent
relapse.
  Relapsers may also fall into another trap. We may doubt that
we can stop using and stay clean. We can never stay clean on
our own. Frustrated, we cry, "I cannot do it!" We beat ourselves
as we come back into the program. We imagine that our fellow
members will not respect the courage it takes to come back. We
have learned the utmost respect for that type of courage. We
applaud heartily. It is not shameful to relapse--the shame is in
not coming back. We must smash the illusion that we can do it
alone.
  Another type of relapse happens when being clean is not the
top priority. Staying clean must always come first. At times, we
all experience difficulty in our recovery. Emotional lapses result

86 Narcotics Anonymous


   when we don't practice what we have learned. Those who make
   it through these times show a courage not their own. After com-
   ing through one of these periods, we can readily agree that it is
   always darkest before the dawn. Once we get through a difficult
   time clean, we are given a tool of recovery that we can use again
   and again.
      If we relapse, we may feel guilt and embarrassment. Our re-
   lapse is embarrassing, but we cannot save our face and our ass at
   the same time. We find that it is best to get back on the program
   as soon as possible. It is better to swallow our pride than to die
   or to go permanently insane.
      As long as we maintain an attitude of thankfulness for being
   clean, we find it is easier to remain clean. The best way to express
   gratitude is by carrying the message of our experience, strength
   and hope to the still-suffering addict. We are ready to work with
   any suffering addict.
      Living the program on a daily basis provides many valuable
   experiences. If we are plagued by an obsession to use, experi-
   ence has taught us to call a fellow recovering addict and get to
   a meeting.
      Using addicts are self-centered, angry, frightened and lonely
   people. In recovery, we experience spiritual growth. While us-
   ing, we were dishonest, self-seeking and often institutionalized.
   The program allows us to become responsible and productive
   members of society.
      As we begin to function in society, our creative freedom helps
   us sort our priorities and do the basic things first. Daily practice
   of our Twelve Step Program enables us to change from what we
   were to people guided by a Higher Power. With the help of our
   sponsor or spiritual advisor, gradually we learn to trust and de-
   pend on our Higher Power.

We Do Recover

 Although "Politics makes strange bedfellows," as the old saying
 goes, addiction makes us one of a kind. Our personal stories may
 vary in individual pattern but in the end we all have the same
 thing in common.This common illness or disorder is addiction.
 We know well the two things that make up true addiction:
 obsession and compulsion. Obsession--that fixed idea that takes
 us back time and time again to our particular drug, or some
 substitute, to recapture the ease and comfort we once knew.
     Compulsion--once having started the process with one fix,
 one pill, or one drink we cannot stop through our own power
 of will. Because of our physical sensitivity to drugs, we are
 completely in the grip of a destructive power greater than
 ourselves.
     When at the end of the road we find that we can no longer
 function as a human being, either with or without drugs, we
 all face the same dilemma. What is there left to do? There seems
 to be this alternative: either go on as best we can to the bitter
 ends--jails, institutions or death--or find a new way to live. In
 years gone by, very few addicts ever had this last choice. Those
 who are addicted today are more fortunate. For the first time
 in man's entire history, a simple way has been proving itself
 in the lives of many addicts. It is available to us all. This is a
 simple spiritual--not religious--program, known as Narcotics
 Anonymous.
     When my addiction brought me to the point of complete
 powerlessness, uselessness and surrender some fifteen years
 ago, there was no NA. I found A.A., and in that Fellowship
       2

                                   87

    met addicts who had also found that program to be the answer
    to their problem. However, we knew that many were still going
    down the road of disillusion, degradation and death, because
    they were unable to identify with the alcoholic in A.A. Their
    identification was at the level of apparent symptoms and not at
    the deeper level of emotions or feelings, where empathy becomes
    a healing therapy for all addicted people. With several other
    addicts and some members of A.A. who had great faith in us and
    the program, we formed, in July of 1953, what we now know as
    Narcotics Anonymous. We felt that now the addict would find
    from the start as much identification as each needed to convince
    himself that he could stay clean, by the example of others who
    had recovered for many years.
       That this was what was principally needed has proved itself
    in these passing years. That wordless language of recognition,
    belief and faith, which we call empathy, created the atmosphere
    in which we could feel time, touch reality and recognize spiritual
    values long lost to many of us. In our program of recovery we
    are growing in numbers and in strength. Never before have so
    many clean addicts, of their own choice and in free society, been
    able to meet where they please, to maintain their recovery in
    complete creative freedom.
       Even addicts said it could not be done the way we had it
    planned. We believed in openly scheduled meetings--no more
    hiding as other groups had tried. We believed this differed from
    all other methods tried before by those who advocated long
    withdrawal from society. We felt that the sooner the addict could
    face his problem in everyday living, just that much faster would
    he become a real productive citizen. We eventually have to stand
    on our own feet and face life on its own terms, so why not from
    the start.
       Because of this, of course, many relapsed and many were lost
    completely. However, many stayed and some came back after
    their setback. The brighter part is the fact that of those who are

                                                           We Do Recover 89


   now our members, many have long terms of complete abstinence
   and are better able to help the newcomer. Their attitude, based on
   the spiritual values of our steps and traditions, is the dynamic
   force that is bringing increase and unity to our program. Now
   we know that the time has come when that tired old lie, "Once
   an addict, always an addict," will no longer be tolerated by
   either society or the addict himself. We do recover.

Recovery     begins with surrender. From that point, each of us
is reminded that a day clean is a day won. In Narcotics Anony-
mous, our attitudes, thoughts and reactions change. We come to
realize that we are not alien and begin to understand and accept
who we are.
   As long as there have been people, addiction has existed. For
us, addiction is an obsession to use the drugs that are destroying
us, followed by a compulsion that forces us to continue. Complete
abstinence is the foundation for our new way of life.
   In the past, there was no hope for an addict. In Narcotics
Anonymous, we learn to share the loneliness, anger and fear
that addicts have in common and cannot control. Our old ideas
are what got us into trouble. We weren't oriented toward fulfill-
ment; we focused on the emptiness and worthlessness of it all.
We could not deal with success, so failure became a way of life.
In recovery, failures are only temporary setbacks rather than
links in an unbreakable chain. Honesty, open-mindedness and
willingness to change are all new attitudes that help us to admit
our faults and to ask for help. We are no longer compelled to
act against our true nature and to do things that we don't really
want to do.
   Most addicts resist recovery, and the program we share with
them interferes with their using. If newcomers tell us that they
can continue to use drugs in any form and suffer no ill effects,
there are two ways we can look at it. The first possibility is
that they are not addicts. The other is that their disease has not

90 Narcotics Anonymous


   become apparent to them and that they are still denying their ad-
   diction. Addiction and withdrawal distort rational thought, and
   newcomers usually focus on differences rather than similarities.
   They look for ways to disprove the evidence of addiction or dis-
   qualify themselves from recovery.
     Many of us did the same thing when we were new, so when we
   work with others we try not to do or say anything that will give
   them the excuse to continue using. We know that honesty and
   empathy are essential. Complete surrender is the key to recovery,
   and total abstinence is the only thing that has ever worked for us.
   In our experience, no addict who has completely surrendered to
   this program has ever failed to find recovery.
     Narcotics Anonymous is a spiritual, not religious program.
   Any clean addict is a miracle, and keeping the miracle alive is
   an ongoing process of awareness, surrender and growth. For
   an addict, not using is an abnormal state. We learn to live clean.
   We learn to be honest with ourselves and to think of both sides
   of things. Decision making is rough at first. Before we got clean,
   most of our actions were guided by impulse. Today, we are not
   locked into this type of thinking. We are free.
     In our recovery, we find it essential to accept reality. Once we
   can do this, we do not find it necessary to use drugs in an attempt
   to change our perceptions. Without drugs, we have a chance to
   begin functioning as useful human beings, if we accept ourselves
   and the world exactly as it is. We learn that conflicts are a part of
   reality, and we learn new ways to resolve them instead of run-
   ning from them. They are a part of the real world. We learn not
   to become emotionally involved with problems. We deal with
   what is at hand and try not to force solutions. We have learned
   that if a solution isn't practical, it isn't spiritual. In the past, we
   made simple situations into problems; we made mountains out
   of molehills. Our best ideas got us here. In recovery, we learn
   to depend on a Power greater than ourselves. We don't have all
   the answers or solutions, but we can learn to live without drugs.

                                                     We Do Recover 91


We can stay clean and enjoy life, if we remember to live "Just for
Today."
   We are not responsible for our disease, only for our recovery.
As we begin to apply what we have learned, our lives begin to
change for the better. We seek help from addicts who are enjoy-
ing lives free from the obsession to use drugs. We do not have to
understand this program for it to work. All we have to do is to
follow direction.
   We get relief through the Twelve Steps, which are essential to
the recovery process, because they are a new, spiritual way of life
that allows us to participate in our own recovery.
   From the first day, the Twelve Steps become a part of our lives.
At first, we may be filled with negativity, and only allow the First
Step to take hold. Later, we have less fear and can use these tools
more fully and to our greater advantage. We realize that old feel-
ings and fears are symptoms of our disease. Real freedom is now
possible.
   As we recover, we gain a new outlook on being clean. We en-
joy a feeling of release and freedom from the desire to use. We
find that everyone we meet eventually has something to offer.
We become able to receive as well as to give. Life can become
a new adventure for us. We come to know happiness, joy and
freedom.
   There is no model of the recovering addict. When the drugs
go and the addict works the program, wonderful things happen.
Lost dreams awaken and new possibilities arise. Our willingness
to grow spiritually keeps us buoyant. When we take the actions
indicated in the steps, the results are a change in our personality.
It is our actions that are important. We leave the results to our
Higher Power.
   Recovery becomes a contact process; we lose the fear of touch-
ing and of being touched. We learn that a simple, loving hug can
make all the difference in the world when we feel alone. We ex-
perience real love and real friendship.

92 Narcotics Anonymous


     We know that we are powerless over a disease that is incur-
   able, progressive and fatal. If not arrested, it gets worse until
   we die. We cannot deal with the obsession and compulsion. The
   only alternative is to stop using and start learning how to live.
   When we are willing to follow this course of action and take ad-
   vantage of the help available to us, a whole new life is possible.
   In this way, we do recover.
     Today, secure in the love of the Fellowship, we can finally look
   another human being in the eye and be grateful for who we are.

Just for Today--
Living the Program

  Tell yourself:

  Just for today my thoughts will be on my recovery, living
        and enjoying life without the use of drugs.

  Just for today I will have faith in someone in NA who believes
        in me and wants to help me in my recovery.

  Just for today I will have a program. I will try to follow it
         to the best of my ability.

  Just for today through NA I will try to get a better perspective
        on my life.

  Just for today I will be unafraid, my thoughts will be on my
        new associations, people who are not using and who have
         found a new way of life. So long as I follow that way,
         I have nothing to fear.

We   admit that our lives have been unmanageable, but some-
times we have a problem admitting our need for help. Our own
self-will leads to many problems in our recovery. We want and
demand that things always go our way. We should know from
our past experience that our way of doing things did not work.
The principle of surrender guides us into a way of life in which
we draw our strength from a Power greater than ourselves. Our
daily surrender to our Higher Power provides the help we need.
As addicts, we have trouble with acceptance, which is critical to
our recovery. When we refuse to practice acceptance, we are, in



                                   93

94 Narcotics Anonymous


   effect, still denying our faith in a Higher Power. Worrying is a
   lack of faith.
     Surrendering our will puts us in contact with a Higher Power
   who fills the empty place inside that nothing could ever fill. We
   learned to trust God for help daily. Living just for today relieves
   the burden of the past and the fear of the future. We learned to
   take whatever actions are necessary and to leave the results in
   the hands of our Higher Power.
     The Narcotics Anonymous Program is spiritual. We strongly
   suggest that members make an attempt to find a Higher Power
   of their understanding. Some of us have profound spiritual ex-
   periences, dramatic and inspirational in nature. For others, the
   awakening is more subtle. We recover in an atmosphere of ac-
   ceptance and respect for one another's beliefs. We try to avoid
   the self-deception of arrogance and self-righteousness. As we
   develop faith in our daily lives, we find that our Higher Power
   supplies us with the strength and guidance that we need.
     Each of us is free to work out our own concept of a Higher
   Power. Many of us were suspicious and skeptical because of
   disappointments that we have had with religion. As new mem-
   bers, the talk of God we heard in meetings repelled us. Until we
   sought our own answers in this area, we were trapped in the
   ideas gathered from our past. Agnostics and atheists sometimes
   start by just talking to "whatever's there." There is a spirit or an
   energy that can be felt in the meetings. This is sometimes the
   newcomer's first concept of a Higher Power. Ideas from the past
   are often incomplete and unsatisfactory. Everything we know is
   subject to revision, especially what we know about the truth. We
   re-evaluate our old ideas, so we can become acquainted with the
   new ideas that lead to a new way of life. We recognize that we
   are human with a physical, mental and spiritual sickness. When
   we accept that our addiction caused our own hell and that there
   is a power available to help us, we begin to make progress in
   solving our problems.

                                  Just for Today--Living the Program 95


  Lack of daily maintenance can show up in many ways.
Through open-minded effort, we come to rely on a daily rela-
tionship with God as we understand Him. Each day most of us
ask our Higher Power to help us stay clean, and each night we
give thanks for the gift of recovery. As our lives become more
comfortable, many of us lapse into spiritual complacency, and
risking relapse, we find ourselves in the same horror and loss of
purpose from which we have been given only a daily reprieve.
This is, hopefully, when our pain motivates us to renew our
daily spiritual maintenance. One way that we can continue a
conscious contact, especially in hard times, is to list the things
for which we are grateful.
  Many of us have found that setting aside quiet time for our-
selves is helpful in making conscious contact with our Higher
Power. By quieting the mind, meditation can lead us to calmness
and serenity. This quieting of the mind can be done in any place,
time, or manner, according to the individual.
  Our Higher Power is accessible to us at all times. We receive
guidance when we ask for knowledge of God's will for us. Grad-
ually, as we become more God-centered than self-centered, our
despair turns to hope. Change also involves the great source of
fear, the unknown. Our Higher Power is the source of courage
that we need to face this fear.
  Some things we must accept, others we can change. The wis-
dom to know the difference comes with growth in our spiritual
program. If we maintain our spiritual condition daily, we find it
easier to deal with the pain and confusion. This is the emotional
stability that we so badly need. With the help of our Higher
Power, we never have to use again.
  Any clean addict is a miracle. We keep this miracle alive in on-
going recovery with positive attitudes. If, after a period of time,
we find ourselves in trouble with our recovery, we have probably
stopped doing one or more of the things that helped us in the
earlier stages of our recovery.

96 Narcotics Anonymous


      Three basic spiritual principles are honesty, open-
   mindedness, and willingness. These are the how of our program.
   The initial honesty that we express is the desire to stop using.
   Next we honestly admit our powerlessness and the unmanage-
   ability of our lives.
      Rigorous honesty is the most important tool in learning to live
   for today. Although honesty is difficult to practice, it is most re-
   warding. Honesty is the antidote to our diseased thinking. Our
   newly found faith serves as a firm foundation for courage in the
   future.
      What we knew about living before we came to NA almost
   killed us. Managing our own lives got us to the Narcotics Anon-
   ymous Program. We came to NA knowing very little about how
   to be happy and enjoy life. A new idea cannot be grafted onto a
   closed mind. Being open-minded allows us to hear something
   that might save our lives. It allows us to listen to opposing points
   of view, and come to conclusions of our own. Open-mindedness
   leads us to the very insights that have eluded us during our lives.
   It is this principle that allows us to participate in a discussion
   without jumping to conclusions or predetermining right and
   wrong. We no longer need to make fools of ourselves by stand-
   ing up for nonexistent virtues. We have learned that it is okay to
   not know all the answers, for then we are teachable and can learn
   to live our new life successfully.
      Open-mindedness without willingness, however, will get us
   nowhere. We must be willing to do whatever is necessary to re-
   cover. We never know when the time will come when we must
   put forth all the effort and strength we have just to stay clean.
      Honesty, open-mindedness, and willingness work hand in
   hand. The lack of one of these principles in our personal pro-
   gram can lead to relapse, and will certainly make recovery diffi-
   cult and painful when it could be simple. This program is a vital
   part of our everyday living. If it were not for this program, most
   of us would be dead or institutionalized. Our viewpoint changes

                                      Just for Today--Living the Program 97


from that of a loner to that of a member. We emphasize setting
our house in order, because it brings us relief. We trust in our
Higher Power for the strength to meet our needs.
   One way to practice the principles of how is by taking a daily
inventory. Our inventory allows us to recognize our daily growth.
We shouldn't forget about our assets while striving to eliminate
our defects. The old self-deception and self-centeredness can be
replaced with spiritual principles.
   Staying clean is the first step in facing life. When we practice ac-
ceptance, our lives are simplified. When problems arise, we hope
to be well-equipped with the tools of the program. We honestly
have to surrender our own self-centeredness and self-destruc-
tiveness. In the past, we believed desperation would give us the
strength to survive. Now we accept responsibility for our prob-
lems and see that we're equally responsible for our solutions.
   As recovering addicts, we come to know gratitude. As our
defects are removed, we are free to become all that we can. We
emerge as new individuals with an awareness of ourselves and
the ability to take our places in the world.
   In living the steps, we begin to let go of our self-obsession. We
ask a Higher Power to remove our fear of facing ourselves and
life. We redefine ourselves by working the steps and using the
tools of recovery. We see ourselves differently. Our personalities
change. We become feeling people, capable of responding ap-
propriately to life. We put spiritual living first and learn to use
patience, tolerance and humility in our daily affairs.
   Other people in our lives help us to develop trust and loving
attitudes, we demand less and give more. We are slower to anger
and quicker to forgive. We learn about the love that we receive in
our Fellowship. We begin to feel lovable which is a feeling totally
alien to our old egocentric selves.
   Ego used to control us in all sorts of subtle ways. Anger is our
reaction to our present reality. Resentments are reliving past ex-
periences again and again, and fear is our response to the future.

98 Narcotics Anonymous


   We need to become willing to let God remove these defects that
   burden our spiritual growth.
     New ideas are available to us through the sharing of our living
   experience. By rigorously practicing the few simple guidelines
   in this chapter, we recover daily. The principles of the program
   shape our personalities.
     From the isolation of our addiction, we find a fellowship of
   people with a common bond of recovery. NA is like a lifeboat in
   a sea of isolation, hopelessness and destructive chaos. Our faith,
   strength and hope come from people sharing their recovery and
   from our relationship with the God of our own understanding.
   At first it feels awkward to share feelings. Part of the pain of ad-
   diction is being cut off from this sharing experience. If we find
   ourselves in a bad place or we sense trouble coming, we call
   someone or go to a meeting. We learn to seek help before making
   difficult decisions. By humbling ourselves and asking for help,
   we can get through the toughest of times. I can't, we can! In this
   way we find the strength that we need. We form a mutual bond,
   as we share our spiritual and mental resources.
     Sharing in regularly scheduled meetings and one-on-one
   with recovering addicts helps us stay clean. Attending meetings
   reminds us of what it is like to be new and of the progressive na-
   ture of our disease. Attending our home group provides encour-
   agement from the people that we get to know. This sustains our
   recovery and helps us in our daily living. When we honestly tell
   our own story, someone else may identify with us. Serving the
   needs of our members and making our message available gives
   us a feeling of joy. Service gives us opportunities to grow in ways
   that touch all parts of our lives. Our experience in recovery may
   help them deal with their problems, what worked for us might
   work for them. Most addicts are able to accept this type of shar-
   ing, even from the very beginning. The get-togethers after our
   meetings are good opportunities to share things that we didn't
   get to discuss during the meeting. This is also a good time to talk

                                  Just for Today--Living the Program 99


one-on-one with our sponsors. Things we need to hear will sur-
face and become clear to us.
  By sharing the experience of our recovery with newcomers, we
help ourselves stay clean. We share comfort and encouragement
with others. Today we have people in our lives who stand with
us. Getting away from our self-centeredness gives us a better
perspective on life. By asking for help, we can change. Sharing is
risky at times, but by becoming vulnerable we are able to grow.
  Some will come to Narcotics Anonymous still trying to use
people to help them continue their habit. Their closed mind is
a barrier against change. A spirit of open-mindedness, coupled
with an admission of powerlessness, is a key that will unlock the
door to recovery. If someone with a drug problem comes to us
seeking recovery, and is willing, we gladly share with them how
we stay clean.
  We develop self-esteem as we help others find a new way of life.
When we honestly evaluate what we have, we can learn to appre-
ciate it. We begin to feel worthwhile by being members of NA. We
can carry the gifts of recovery with us everywhere. The Twelve
Steps of NarcoticsAnonymous are a progressive recovery process
established in our daily living. Ongoing recovery is dependent on
our relationship with a loving God who cares for us and will do
for us what we find impossible to do for ourselves.
  During our recovery, each of us comes to our own understand-
ing of the program. If we have difficulties, we trust our groups,
our sponsors and our Higher Power to guide us. Thus, recovery,
as found in Narcotics Anonymous, comes both from within and
without.
  We live a day at a time but also from moment to moment.
When we stop living in the here and now, our problems become
magnified unreasonably. Patience isn't a strong point with us.
That's why we need our slogans and our NA friends to remind
us to live the program just for today.

As   our recovery progressed, we became increasingly aware of
ourselves and the world around us. Our needs and wants, our
assets and liabilities were revealed to us. We came to realize that
we had no power to change the outside world, we could only
change ourselves. The Program of Narcotics Anonymous pro-
vides an opportunity for us to ease the pain of living through
spiritual principles.
   We are very fortunate to have had this program. Before, very
few people recognized that addiction was a disease. Recovery
was only a dream.
   The responsible, productive, drug-free lives of thousands of
members illustrate the effectiveness of our program. Recovery
is a reality for us today. By working the steps, we are rebuilding
our fractured personalities. Narcotics Anonymous is a healthy
environment for growth. As a fellowship, we love and cherish
one another, supporting our new way of life together.
   As we grow, we come to understand humility as acceptance
of both our assets and our liabilities. What we want most is to
feel good about ourselves. Today we have real feelings of love,
joy, hope, sadness, excitement. Our feelings are not our old drug-
induced feelings.
   Sometimes we find ourselves caught up in old ideas, even
with time in the program. The basics are always important to
recovery. We need to avoid old thinking patterns, both the old
ideas and the tendency toward complacency. We cannot afford
to become complacent, because our disease is with us twenty-
four hours a day. If, while practicing these principles, we allow



                                101

102 Narcotics Anonymous


    ourselves to feel superior or inferior, we isolate ourselves. We are
    headed for trouble if we feel apart from other addicts. Separation
    from the atmosphere of recovery and from the spirit of service to
    others slows our spiritual growth. Complacency keeps us from
    good will, love and compassion.
      If we are unwilling to listen to others, we will deny the need
    for improvement. We learn to become flexible and to admit when
    others are right and we are wrong. As new things are revealed,
    we feel renewed. We need to stay open-minded and willing to do
    that one extra thing, go to one extra meeting, stay on the phone
    one extra minute, and help a newcomer stay clean one extra day.
    This extra effort is vital to our recovery.
      We come to know ourselves for the first time. We experience
    new sensations: to love, to be loved, to know that people care
    about us and to have concern and compassion for others. We
    find ourselves doing and enjoying things that we never thought
    we would be doing. We make mistakes, and we accept and learn
    from them. We experience failure, and we learn how to succeed.
    Often we have to face some type of crisis during our recovery,
    such as the death of a loved one, financial difficulties or divorce.
    These are realities of life, and they don't go away just because
    we get clean. Some of us, even after years of recovery, found
    ourselves jobless, homeless or penniless. We entertained the
    thought that staying clean was not paying off, and the old think-
    ing stirred up self-pity, resentment and anger. No matter how
    painful life's tragedies can be for us, one thing is clear, we must
    not use, no matter what!
      This is a program of total abstinence. There are times, however,
    such as in cases of health problems involving surgery and/or ex-
    treme physical injury, when medication may be valid. This does
    not constitute a license to use. There is no safe use of drugs for
    us. Our bodies don't know the difference between the drugs pre-
    scribed by a physician for pain and the drugs prescribed by our-
    selves to get high. As addicts, our skill at self-deception will be

                                              More Will Be Revealed 103


at its peak in such a situation. Often our minds will manufacture
additional pain as an excuse to use. Turning it over to our Higher
Power and getting the support of our sponsor and other members
can prevent us from becoming our own worst enemies. Being
alone during such times would give our disease an opportunity
to take over. Honest sharing can dispel our fears of relapse.
   Serious illness or surgery can present particular problems for
us. Physicians should have specific knowledge of our addiction.
Remember that we, not our doctors, are ultimately responsible for
our recovery and our decisions. To minimize the danger, there are
a few specific options that we may consider. Using local anesthe-
sia, avoiding our drug of choice, stopping drug use while we are
still hurting, and spending extra days in the hospital in case with-
drawal occurs are some of our options.
   Whatever pain we experience will pass. Through prayer,
meditation and sharing, we keep our minds off our discomfort
and have the strength to keep our priorities in order. It is im-
perative to keep NA members close to us at all times, if possible.
It is amazing how our minds will go back to our old ways and
old thinking. You'd be surprised how much pain we can handle
without medication. In this program of total abstinence, how-
ever, we need to feel no guilt after having taken a minimum
amount of medication prescribed by an informed professional
for extreme physical pain.
   We grow through pain in recovery and often find that such
a crisis is a gift, an opportunity to experience growth by living
clean. Before recovery, we were unable to even conceive of the
thought that problems brought gifts. This gift may be finding
strength within ourselves or regaining the feeling of self-respect
that we had lost.
   Spiritual growth, love, and compassion are idle potentials un-
til shared with a fellow addict. By giving unconditional love in
the Fellowship, we become more loving, and by sharing spiritual
growth we become more spiritual.

      By carrying this message to another addict, we are reminded
    of our own beginnings. Having had an opportunity to remember
    old feelings and behaviors, we are able to see our own personal
    and spiritual growth. In the process of answering the questions
    of another, our own thinking becomes clearer. Newer members
    are a constant source of hope, ever reminding us that the pro-
    gram works. We have the opportunity to live the knowledge ac-
    quired by staying clean, when we work with newcomers.
      We have learned to value the respect of others. We are pleased
    when people depend on us. For the first time in our lives, we
    may be asked to serve in positions of responsibility in commu-
    nity organizations outside of NA. Our opinions are sought and
    valued by non-addicts in areas other than addiction and recov-
    ery. We can enjoy our families in a new way and may become a
    credit to them instead of an embarrassment or a burden. They
    can be proud of us today. Our individual interests can broaden
    to include social or even political issues. Hobbies and recreation
    give us new pleasure. It gives us good feelings to know that
    aside from our value to others as recovering addicts, we are also
    of value as human beings.
      The reinforcement received by sponsorship is limitless. We
    spent years taking from others in every conceivable way. Words
    cannot describe the sense of spiritual awareness that we receive
    when we have given something, no matter how small, to another
    person.
      We are each other's eyes and ears. When we do something
    wrong, our fellow addicts help us by showing us what we can-
    not see. We sometimes find ourselves caught up in old ideas. We
    need to constantly review our feelings and thoughts if we are to
    stay enthusiastic and grow spiritually. This enthusiasm will aid
    our ongoing recovery.
      Today we have the freedom of choice. As we work the pro-
    gram to the best of our ability, the obsession with self is removed.
    Much of our loneliness and fear is replaced by the love and

                                               More Will Be Revealed 105


security of the Fellowship. Helping a suffering addict is one of
the greatest experiences life has to offer. We are willing to help.
We have had similar experiences and understand fellow addicts
as no one else can. We offer hope, for we know that a better way
of life is now real for us, and we give love because it was given so
freely to us. New frontiers are open to us as we learn how to love.
Love can be the flow of life energy from one person to another.
By caring, sharing, and praying for others, we become a part of
them. Through empathy, we allow addicts to become part of us.
  As we do this, we undergo a vital spiritual experience and are
changed. On a practical level, changes occur because what's ap-
propriate to one phase of recovery may not be for another. We
constantly let go of what has served its purpose, and let God
guide us through the current phase with what works here and
now.
  As we become more God-reliant and gain more self-respect,
we realize that we don't need to feel superior or inferior to any-
one. Our real value is in being ourselves. Our egos, once so large
and dominant, now take a back seat because we are in harmony
with a loving God. We find that we lead richer, happier and
much fuller lives when we lose self-will.
  We become able to make wise and loving decisions, based on
principles and ideals that have real value in our lives. By shap-
ing our thoughts with spiritual ideals, we are freed to become
who we want to be. What we had feared, we can now overcome
through our dependence on a loving God. Faith has replaced our
fear and given us freedom from ourselves.
  In recovery, we also strive for gratitude. We feel grateful for
ongoing God-consciousness. Whenever we confront a difficulty
that we do not think we can handle, we ask God to do for us
what we cannot do for ourselves.
  A spiritual awakening is an ongoing process. We experience a
wider view of reality as we grow spiritually. An opening of our
minds to new spiritual and physical experiences is the key to

106 Narcotics Anonymous


    better awareness. As we grow spiritually we become attuned to
    our feelings and our purpose in life.
       By loving ourselves, we become able to truly love others. This
    is a spiritual awakening that comes as a result of living this pro-
    gram. We find ourselves daring to care and love!
       Higher mental and emotional functions, such as conscience
    and the ability to love, were sharply affected by our drug use.
    Living skills were reduced to the animal level. Our spirit was
    broken. The capacity to feel human was lost. This seems extreme,
    but many of us have been in this state.
       In time, through recovery, our dreams come true. We don't
    mean that we necessarily become rich or famous. However, by
    realizing the will of our Higher Power, dreams do come true in
    recovery.
       One of the continuing miracles of recovery is becoming a
    productive, responsible member of society. We need to tread
    carefully into areas that expose us to ego-inflating experience,
    prestige and manipulation that may be difficult for us. We have
    found that the way to remain a productive, responsible member
    of society is to put our recovery first. NAcan survive without us,
    but we cannot survive without NA.
       Narcotics Anonymous offers only one promise and that is
    freedom from active addiction, the solution that eluded us for so
    long. We will be freed from our self-made prisons.
       Living just for today, we have no way of knowing what will
    happen to us. We are often amazed at how things work out for
    us. We are recovering in the here and now and the future be-
    comes an exciting journey. If we had written down our list of
    expectations when we came to the program, we would have
    been cheating ourselves. Hopeless living problems have become
    joyously changed. Our disease has been arrested, and now any-
    thing is possible.
       We become increasingly open-minded and open to new ideas
    in all areas of our lives. Through active listening, we hear things

                                                More Will Be Revealed 107


that work for us. This ability to listen is a gift and grows as we
grow spiritually. Life takes on a new meaning when we open
ourselves to this gift. In order to receive, we must be willing to
give.
   In recovery, our ideas of fun change. We are now free to enjoy
the simple things in life, like fellowship and living in harmony
with nature. We now have become free to develop a new under-
standing of life.As we look back, we are grateful for our new life.
It is so unlike the events that brought us here.
   While using, we thought that we had fun and that non-users
were deprived of it. Spirituality enables us to live life to its full-
est, feeling grateful for who we are and for what we have done in
life. Since the beginning of our recovery, we have found that joy
doesn't come from material things, but from within ourselves.
We find that when we lose self-obsession, we are able to under-
stand what it means to be happy, joyous, and free. Indescribable
joy comes from sharing from the heart, we no longer need to lie
to gain acceptance.
   Narcotics Anonymous offers addicts a program of recovery
that is more than just a life without drugs. Not only is this way
of life better than the hell we lived, it is better than any life that
we have ever known.
   We have found a way out, and we see it work for others. Each
day more will be revealed.

Introduction to
Our Members Share

In our meetings, our lives, and our literature, we help each other
by sharing our experience and the tools we use to live clean and
recover. The Basic Text is an expression of this desire to carry
our message. The first ten chapters contain our collective wis-
dom describing the program, and now we turn to our individual
experiences living the program. Our members' lives depend on
our program; our program comes to life through the voices of
our members.
  Our First Tradition teaches us to look past our differences
for our common welfare. The concept of unity described in this
tradition is not the same thing as uniformity. Over time we find
that those differences are precisely the things that enrich us. In
the particulars of our stories the truth of our message comes
through and we see how alike we really are. This can seem like
a contradiction in NA: Our development as individuals and as
a fellowship is about fostering our common bonds and common
identity; at the same time, we cultivate and cherish the things
that make each of us who we are. To stay strong and grow, we
need both of these points of view.
  Since our Basic Text was first published, we have grown and
changed as a fellowship. Our membership has broadened, and
our experience has deepened. Today we are truly worldwide,
and each of our local NA communities contains worlds as well.
Together we made a decision to revise this part of the book to
embrace and reflect these changes. In the pages that follow, our
members share their experiences getting clean, staying clean,
and living clean.


                               111

112 Narcotics Anonymous


      The experience shared here is as diverse as we are. Our mem-
    bers write about going back to school, losing people they love,
    struggling with health problems, making amends, coming to
    terms with their sexuality, raising children, serving the fellow-
    ship we all love, and countless other successes and challenges.
    You may read about choices that are contrary to your beliefs or
    to the customs of your NA community. The individual paths our
    members choose to walk do not necessarily reflect the views of
    NA as a whole, and it is important to keep in mind that these
    are all personal experiences. It would be impossible, in one col-
    lection, to fully reflect the diversity in who our members are or
    what we have gone through, but here we have gathered some of
    that richness.
      Each individual piece is very briefly summarized at the begin-
    ning and in the Table of Contents. If you are looking for some-
    thing specific (like someone confronted with illness, or someone
    who got clean young) you may be able to find it more quickly.
      We have organized the collection into four sections, each of
    which begins with an assortment of brief reflections from our
    members. The first section, "Beginnings," consists of six stories
    from previous editions of the Basic Text. The pieces have been
    chosen, in part, for their historical significance and are not edited
    for publication here. These voices of some of our early members
    act as a window on our formative years.
      After "Beginnings," the text is divided into three more sec-
    tions. In the "Coming Home" section, members share about
    finding NA, or in some cases, starting NA in their part of the
    world. Our readings tell us that anyone can find a home in NA
    "regardless of age, race, sexual identity, creed, religion, or lack of
    religion." In the "Regardless of..." section, members talk about
    their journey to find acceptance in NA, and to make NA a place
    where all of us can feel safe and welcome. The final section, "Life
    on Life's Terms," focuses on practicing the principles in the face
    of all that life offers: Fully awake and alive, we confront joy and
    tragedy and the simple pleasures of day-to-day life.

  You may not relate to everything you read here--just as you
might not identify with everyone who shares in an NAmeeting--
but we hope that at least some of these voices will touch and in-
spire you. In NA we learn that as addicts we are not unique, but
as people we are individuals, and our experience matters. Col-
lectively we are so much more than the sum of our parts. Each
of us, regardless of our clean time or where we came from, has
something to contribute by sharing openly and honestly, and
something to gain when we listen with an open heart.


                        Beginnings

This sample of stories from early members gives some glimpses
of NA in the late seventies and early eighties. They have been
chosen in part for their historical significance and, as such,
have not been edited. Over time we have learned to be clear
in our language and identification; these stories, however, are
reproduced exactly as they were published in the Fifth Edition
Basic Text (1988).


        The short passages that begin this section are excerpted
          from stories in previous editions of the Basic Text.

Reflections

It was suggested to me that I start an NA meeting in my area.
I was frightened and didn't think I had enough clean time. My
friends told me that I could be miserable as long as I wanted to
be. With the help of God and other addicts, that meeting began
and continues to thrive.
   I want to keep what has been given to me, so I actively share
through loving service to NA, wherever and however I am
asked. The spirit of this Fellowship is in me today. I have come
to know unconditional love.



I was  5'5" tall, and weighed 282 pounds. I ate compulsively to
                                              3

try and handle my feelings and emotions and to make me feel
better. As a matter of fact, this is how I originally got into using
heavy drugs. I wanted to lose weight so desperately that I be-
came willing to use heroin. I thought I would be smart enough
not to get hooked, that I could use and lose my appetite, feel
good and outsmart the game. I bounced around the country and
ended up in penitentiaries and jails. This was the beginning of
the end; not only was I a compulsive overeater and remained fat,
but I was also addicted to the drugs I was using.
   When I came to this program, I found something that I had
never experienced before--total acceptance for who and what I
was. I was invited to keep coming back to a Fellowship that told
me there were no fees or dues--that I had already paid my dues
via my past life--and that if I kept coming back, I would find
total freedom and a new way of life.

       There is no question about it, I owe my life to the Narcotics
    Anonymous Fellowship and God.



    So   much had been going really good. I had a diploma, a brand
    new car, a driver's license and a good relationship with my
    parents. My girlfriend was seeing a therapist who told her we
    should get involved in something together, like starting an NA
    meeting in our area. The closest NA meeting was over an hour
    away, and there were only two a month at that. After we started
    the meeting, she got high and moved out. My best friend had
    been getting high for a while and they started going out together,
    and that really ripped me up inside. I had a dog who I cried to
    every night and he couldn't even stand it and ran away.
       Since I had started this NA meeting, I continued to go and the
    meeting grew. Here I was with two years, crying in the meet-
    ing, feeling sorry for myself and depressed and having new-
    comers with thirty days clean telling me it would be better, be
    grateful for what you have, and keep coming back. People who
    were new in the Fellowship would come over to my house and
    Twelfth Step me. They kept me coming back. They told me that
    they loved me. I was depressed for two months like that and
    during that time two more meetings started. I was making three
    meetings a week and I started working the steps. I was getting
    involved in our area service and started being grateful for every-
    thing I had. I was so grateful to be alive and I believed that that
    was because of the NA Fellowship.



    I remember    feeling like I didn't belong in NA because pot was
    really my problem although I had used other drugs. I read the
    little white pamphlet Narcotics Anonymous. It said an addict was
    someone who "lived to use and used to live" and that our lives

                                                          Beginnings 119


and thinking were centered on getting and using drugs. That
sounded like me. Then it said they didn't care what drug I used
and the only requirement for membership was the honest desire
to stop using. I thought, "Well, maybe, just maybe they would
let me stay." I started going to a meeting every day or I talked
with another addict. The members told me they needed me and
I began to feel a part of! I attended regularly and tried to support
new meetings. I learned about the steps and I tried to work them.
I didn't use, I took inventories, I made amends, and I prayed.
That's one of the things I'm grateful for is having the freedom to
have a God as I understood Him. One day I realized I was be-
ing freed from my addiction. The obsession and the compulsion
were no longer the dominating force in my life; growing spiritu-
ally was.



A year   before I came to Narcotics Anonymous I found myself
hopelessly addicted to cough syrup, drinking five or six four-
ounce bottles a day. I needed help so I went to a doctor; he pre-
scribed dexedrine and would give me a shot that made me feel
good. I found myself going to him practically every day.
   This continued for about eight months and I was very happy
with my new found legal addiction. I was also getting codeine
from a different doctor. I now became insanely afraid and began
drinking too. This went on around the clock for a month and I
ended up in a mental institution. After being released from the
hospital, I thought I was free from narcotics and now I could
drink socially. I soon found out I could not. It was then that I
sought help from NA.
   Here I learned that my real problem did not lie in the drugs
that I had been using, but in a distorted personality that had de-
veloped over the years of my using and even before that. In NAI
was able to help myself with the help of others in the Fellowship.
I find I am making progress in facing reality and I'm growing

120 Narcotics Anonymous


   a day at a time. I find new interests now that mean something,
   and realize that that was one of the things which I was looking
   for in drugs.



   I had  a job and was working steadily, but my life wasn't work-
   ing; I was still drug dependent. This was the beginning of the
   end, the start of my recovery. I was in a state of hopeless despera-
   tion; I just wanted to lay down and die.
     I looked for a methadone program, but none were available.
   My boss asked me the next day what was wrong with me. Before
   I knew it, I was telling him the truth. I said I was a drug addict.
   He asked me if I wanted help. I told him, "yes."
     This was the first of many spiritual awakenings. I went to a
   hospital in Louisiana and from there to a halfway house. This is
   where I found Narcotics Anonymous. NA was the tribe I never
   had. I found the same type of people that I had run with on the
   streets. There was something different about them. They had a
   peace I wanted.



   Today,   I can look in the mirror and laugh at myself. I won't say
   that I have a good self image today, but it's better than it used to
   be. When I was using, I mastered the art of fight or flee. I would
   either run from a situation or fight it out, but never face it. Most
   of the time, it was me I was running from. The words serenity
   and surrender were foreign to my vocabulary. I am learning that
   I usually have as much serenity as I have surrendered.
     For half my life I have been careening wildly through the sea
   of chaos and destruction. The Program of Narcotics Anonymous
   has shown me serenity and direction. I am growing to realize
   that my experience can benefit those who still suffer. The free-
   dom that I have always sought I have found in the steps of the
   program.

            When he was using he went from one "mother"
          to another--from his mother's house to the military
      to marriage--until his wife tired of the insanity and found
     the only NA meeting in the world. In his story from our First
      Edition, this addict admits that it took him time but finally
        he learned to take action and be responsible for himself.


I Found the Only NA Meeting
in the World

My    name is Bob B. from Los Angeles. On the subject of people,
places and things, my story is not much different from the
executive, it's just on the opposite end of the stick.
  I grew up on the wrong side of the tracks, poor, deprived, dur-
ing the depression, in a broken home. The words of love were
never spoken in my household. There were a lot of kids in my
house.
  Most of the things I remember about my life are recalled in
retrospect. While they were happening, I didn't know anything
about it. I just remember going through life feeling different,
feeling deprived. I never felt quite comfortable wherever I was,
with whatever I had at any given time. I grew up in a fantasy
world. Things on the other side of the fence always looked bet-
ter. My grass was never green enough. My head was always out
to lunch. I learned all the short cuts in order to make it through
school.
  I always had a dream of leaving home. It was not the place to
be. My great fantasy was that there was going to be something
good out there somewhere.
  I started using drugs fairly late in life, I was eighteen years old. I
say late in comparison with the age kids are doing it today.
  My mother ruled her house with a big stick. That was her meth-
od. The constant way I gained attention was by getting my butt
whipped on a daily basis. I found another way to get attention

                                  121

122 Narcotics Anonymous


    was to get sick. When I got sick I got the things I felt were neces-
    sary, love and attention.
      I blamed my mother because she didn't make better choices in
    her life so that I could have been happy growing up.
      I went into the military because it was a place to run. I stayed
    in the military for a long time because they afforded me the same
    opportunities I had at home; three hots, a cot, and no responsibil-
    ity. I can say I was a responsible person because I had rank and
    did this or that, but it was only because they gave me advance
    directions on what to do, when to do it, and how much to do.
      My first drug was alcohol. I found that there were two per-
    sonalities. When under the influence of alcohol and, later other
    narcotics, there was a personality change.
      I found out later, however, that this personality change went
    back even farther. I was two people before I even started using.
    I had learned how to steal early. I had learned how to lie early. I
    had learned how to cheat early. I used these processes success-
    fully. I was addicted to stealing long before I was addicted to
    drugs because it made me feel good. If I had some of your good-
    ies to spread around, I felt good. I had a thing about stealing. I
    couldn't go into a place unless I took something.
      I was so naive, I knew nothing about drugs. Drugs were not
    something that were talked about in the 1930's and 1940's. It is
    not that drugs have changed, they just didn't talk about them
    before. They didn't talk about sex, or drugs, or religion, or dis-
    cuss or explain them. It just wasn't one of those things that was
    talked about.
      I first experienced my drug of choice, heroin, in the Far East.
    I heard about opium and tried that. I found that you could cook
    up heroin and put it in a spike. There were a great variety of
    drugs in other countries that you could get by just walking into
    a drug store and asking for them. So I stayed out of the country
    for nine years. That way I wasn't confronted with the attitudes
    and restrictions in the United States.

                                                          Beginnings 123


   I knew nothing about the progression of my disease. I knew
nothing about addiction. I ran around in the ignorance of addic-
tion for a lot of years, not knowing, just not knowing.
   No one explained to me that when you use drugs over a year's
time you can get hooked. No one told me about withdrawal from
drugs. The only thing anyone told me was, "Don't get sick," and
the way to do that was to keep on using.
   One of the problems I found in the military was that they give
you orders, ship you out, and they don't send your connection
with you. You get sick. You try to back that up the next time by
trying to get a big enough supply, and your month's supply lasts
a week, or two or three days.
   I knew nothing about progression of the disease nor the con-
sequences of my actions. The progression of my disease caught
up with me, as far as the military was concerned, when I started
transporting and smuggling. Also, when you use drugs to the
extent that you can't be there for duty, they frown on it. The next
thing they do is take you away and lock you up. Then the mili-
tary did a cruel thing, they put me out on the streets.
   I was ill equipped to take care of myself. I had gone from
one mama to another mother. They had taken care of me, then
I found myself on the street with no one to take care of me. I
knew nothing of paying rent, working or being responsible. So I
had to give that responsibility to whoever I could give it to. I ran
through a lot of mothers.
   I had to learn how to hustle on the street. You have to realize
that the military has a lot of equipment that can be sold and I
used to sell it, because I liked to steal. I had to learn other pro-
cesses, like running through stores winging steaks and cigarettes
under my arm, jumping from second story windows, and run-
ning from policemen.
   I think there is a certain excitement that goes along with drug
addiction. It was a lot like my childhood games of cops and
robbers. I found out that there are more policemen than drug

    addicts. They were standing around watching you. I could never
    understand how they could go into a crowd of people and pick
    me out, and say, "Let's get in the car, let's go." Nine times out of
    ten they had me dirty.
       During the process of finding mothers, one mother found me.
    I thought I should hem this one up and get papers on her, then
    she couldn't run away.
       I chose correctly, I chose someone who wasn't using. I knew
    about the ones that were using. They were never there when I got
    locked up. They never had bail money. They could never visit be-
    cause they were too busy taking care of their own habits.
       So I found one of those unsuspecting ones. She was in school
    and working and she had a place to stay. She had one shortcom-
    ing, she didn't know she needed someone to take care of. I was a
    prime candidate. I wanted to be taken care of. She was going to
    help me get my act together. She proposed to me in jail and I said,
    "Yes, I do. Just go down and pay the bail."
       For the next three years I ran her crazy trying to keep up with
    me. Then she went out and found the only Narcotics Anony-
    mous meeting in the world. How she did that, I don't know. At
    that time, there was only one meeting in the whole world, and
    she went out and found it, and I sent her off to the meeting. I had
    her go check it out.
       You have to realize that in those days, drug addicts were very
    unpopular. To just intimate that two drug addicts were going to
    congregate anywhere would constitute a police stakeout. That's
    the way they treated drug addicts at the time. There was very
    little understanding about addiction. I was very leery about any-
    thing to do about helping drug addicts. I knew what they did
    with drug addicts; they locked them up, period! There was no
    program to go to, except in Ft. Worth and Lexington.
       I always had a sad story to justify my using. One day, after
    one of those six month trips to go get a loaf of bread at the cor-
    ner grocery, I came home and my bags were sitting by the door.

                                                          Beginnings 125


She had told me fifty times or a thousand times, "You got to go."
This time was different. There was something in her voice this
time. So I took my bags and went to the only place there was to
go, the streets.
  I had become accustomed to living in the streets. I knew how
to live in the back of old cars, old laundry rooms, any old empty
building, your house or my house. Of course, I never had my
house. I couldn't pay the rent. I never knew how to pay rent. If I
had three dollars in my pocket, that three dollars was going for
drugs before a place to stay. It was that simple. I think I paid rent
one time while I was using drugs and living on the streets, that
was just to move in. It was called "catch me if you can" from then
on. It usually didn't make any difference, because I was a ward
of the state much of the time anyway. I just ran in the streets until
they locked me up, then I had a place to stay. I could rest up, and
get my health back in order to go back out and do it again.
  I came to Narcotics Anonymous nearly 21 years ago. But I   4

didn't come for me. I came just to keep her mouth shut. I went to
meetings loaded.
  I didn't have a driver's license. I was unemployable. I had no
place to stay. I was the wrong color. I had no money. I didn't have
a car. I didn't have an old lady, or I needed a new one. I took
them all these problems and they would tell me, "Keep coming
back." And they said, "Work the steps." I used to read the steps
and thought that that was working them. I found out years later
that even though I read the steps, I didn't know what I had read.
I did not understand what I read.
  They told me in many places that I was an addict. I had been
labeled an addict. From the military, to the jails, and right on
down the line, I had been labeled. I accepted that, but I didn't
understand it. I had to go out and do some more experimenting
before I got back to the program.
  One of the things I had to learn to do was to understand what
the program was all about. I had to become willing to find out

4Written in 1981

126 Narcotics Anonymous


    what the program was about. Only after standing at the gates of
    death did I want to understand. I think death is the counsel per-
    manent. I had overdosed a number of times, but that was kind of
    like the place where I always wanted to be. It was just before go-
    ing over the brink and everything seemed okay. When I came out
    of it, I could say, "Wow, give me some more." That's insanity!
      The final case for me was that I was about to be shot off a fence,
    and not by my own doing. I didn't like that. Playing cops and
    robbers is dangerous out there. They have guns, and I don't like
    being used for target practice. There were more and more cases
    of policemen sticking guns in my mouth and upside my head,
    and telling me to lay upside a wall.
      My last day of narcotics use or drugs of any type, I had just
    fixed and two policemen got me spread-eagled on a chainlink
    fence that I was trying to get over. I became sober and clean im-
    mediately. Everything became very clear and I didn't want to die
    that way. Something clicked on in my mind and I thought, "It
    doesn't have to be this way."
      After that last rest and recuperation, I found out that I could
    work these steps. The sum total of my life has changed as a direct
    result. I got involved in working the steps, trying to understand
    what they were talking about, to really understand what they
    were talking about. I found there is a certain amount of action
    that goes with every step. I had to get into action about how the
    steps applied to me. I always thought the steps applied to you,
    not me.
      It got down to talking about God and spirituality. I had canned
    God a long time ago, then I put that in church, and I didn't have
    anything to do with church. I found out that God and spirituality
    have nothing to do with church.
      I had to learn to get involved. It has been one hell of an ad-
    venture. My life has changed to such an extent that it is almost
    unbelievable that I was ever there. However, I know from where

                                                          Beginnings 127


I came. I have constant reminders. I need that constant reminder
of newcomers and talking with others.
   This program has become a part of me. It has become a part of
life and living for me. I understand more clearly the things that are
happening in my life today. I no longer fight the process.
   I came to meetings of Narcotics Anonymous in order to take
care of the responsibilities that have been given to me. Today, I
care. I am addicted to the loving and caring and sharing that goes
on in NA. I look forward to more of these things in my life.
   My problem is addiction, it has something to do with drugs
being the means of not coping with life, it has something to do
with that within, that compulsion and that obsession. I now have
the tools to do something about it. The Twelve Steps of recovery
are the tools.

Mid-Pacific Serenity

Iam   a happy, grateful drug addict, clean by the grace of God and
the Twelve Steps of Narcotics Anonymous. Life today is fulfill-
ing and there is joy in my heart.
  It wasn't always this way. I drank and used drugs for twelve
years, on a daily basis for ten of them. I was an addict of the
hopeless variety. It really seems to me that I was born this way.
  I was born and raised in Southern California, in a loving
middle class family. Both my sister and I were wanted, loved
children and were shown that in every way. As far back as I can
remember, I have felt separate from this family and all of life. Of
course, I am talking of an intense fear of life. I cannot remember
feeling the simplicity of being a child.
  I had the addict's personality growing up, self will run riot. I
always wanted my own way, and if I didn't get it, I sure let ev-
eryone know.
  Growing up in Southern California, I seemed to get into all the
normal things, going to the beach, getting into sports, yet always
the fears and feelings of inadequacy never let me live up to my
potential.
  I was an average student throughout school, had lots of friends
yet I withdrew, dominated by the fear. I guess I was about fifteen
when I tried my first drug, alcohol. From the first drink it was
oblivion. Finally I had found freedom from fear, or so I thought.
From the beginning I identified with the rejects, the people who
slept on the beach, under the piers.
  As I look back over these twelve years, I see how I loved each
new drug I tried. Alcohol was only the beginning; if it got you

loaded, I wanted to try it and I always wanted more. It didn't
matter if it was sniffing glue or shooting the best coke or heroin.
I wasn't a rich, choosy addict, I just needed to stay high and all
my energy was put into that direction.
  I quit school in the twelfth grade. Surfing had become part of
my life, so it was off to Hawaii. My parents were very confused
about their son who didn't do a very good job of hiding his des-
peration. To all who were sane and living life, I appeared very
lost and unhappy. You see, it was a very short time after I started
using, that the alcohol and drugs quit doing for me what they
did in the beginning. The fear had returned, only much worse
than before.
  My first trip to Hawaii in 1962 was only the beginning of
many more to come, always trying to run from myself. Hawaii
was, and is, a paradise, but I only saw it through the eyes of be-
ing loaded. Thanks to the warm weather, it was easy to pursue
the only life I knew, the way of life was to wander the streets
and sleep in parked cars or other available shelters. At the age
of nineteen, I was back in Hawaii for the third time, a full-blown
addict and so lost and confused I only knew I had to drink and
use drugs and there was no other way.
  Returning to California at the end of the summer of 1963, I
found myself joining the Navy. Being lost, that seemed to be the
easiest thing to do, just sign my name. It was easier than looking
for a job. I was so burned out already and wanted something dif-
ferent, yet didn't know how to ask for help. The Navy, of course,
was not the answer. The drugs continued and after two years I
was discharged. The psychiatrist said my mind had become dis-
ordered from the use of marijuana and LSD, plus I had jumped
overboard in rage at the Navy.
  I convinced myself that once I got out of the Navy things
would be different, no one would be telling me what to do, but
I met a new friend at this point, the world of fixing. This was in

130 Narcotics Anonymous


    1965 and the next six years were the worst years of my life. As I
    see it today, those years got me into the program.
       After getting out of the Navy, I got married. How and why
    this woman married me is a mystery even today. On our wed-
    ding night, I shot some dope and slept on Venice Beach with my
    dogs. This is the type of behavior a selfish, self-centered addict
    has, concerned only with himself and getting loaded. The way I
    was able to stay loaded was by dealing, always being the middle
    man. The house where we lived was being watched, it was on the
    Venice canal in Venice, California.
       My parents knew what was going on, so with my wife four
    months pregnant they helped us get out of there, and it was back
    to Hawaii. We lived on the north shore, it was a more isolated part
    of Oahu, lots of young people lived there. This was the year 1967
    and at this time, LSD was really popular and everyone was into
    the spiritual thing; Eastern religion and gurus. There were two
    Harvard professors who were taking LSD and saying that you
    could find God, so I thought all that love, peace, and joy sounded
    good. I wanted out of the feelings that I was having. Fear domi-
    nated my life. I had been shooting a lot of speed in California the
    past year. I decided to clean up my life in Hawaii, so I took psy-
    chedelics, smoked hashish and tried to meditate.
       Somewhere I had read that when the student was ready, the
    teacher would appear. Little did I know that the Program of Nar-
    cotics Anonymous was about to be introduced to me, and that it
    would become my teacher.
       I was able to stay away from shooting dope that year. My wife
    and I had a baby girl and were on welfare, living in the country.
    I seemed to be fitting right into the movement of the time; flower
    children, the everything is beautiful consciousness. Yet still, in-
    side, everything wasn't beautiful.
       There was a four bedroom house next door to us for rent, and
    one day this woman appeared and told us that God had told her
    that she was supposed to live there. She was in her fifties, had

                                                         Beginnings 131


long gray hair to her waist and wore a bikini most of the time.
She had no money, but said she was led to this house.
   This woman seemed to radiate a feeling of love and joy that I
had never felt from anyone else before. Immediately upon meet-
ing her, I felt as if I had known her forever. Something in me was
drawn to her. Little did I know that she was to become my spon-
sor, and play such a big part in my life! This was the beginning
of a journey that even today amazes me. It is a way of life, a way
of learning complete trust in a Higher Power. Through a series
of miracles, which I now have come to see as quite normal to my
life, this woman ended up in this house with the rent paid every
month. Needless to say, this house became a program house.
   A meeting was started at this house. It was called the Beach-
combers Spiritual Progress Traveling Group and through the
years it has traveled throughout the United States, from Hawaii
to the East coast, and through Europe twice, always attracting
the addict who still suffers, offering a way up and out.
   I remember my first meeting at this house in 1968. For the first
time, I felt as if I really belonged. Not so much because I heard
people talk of using drugs as I had, but because they spoke of
what was going on inside. For the first time, I found out that
other people had fears also. Yet with all the hope this meeting
brought me, it was only the beginning of a three year period that
I would not want to live through again.
   I identified from that first meeting and wanted a new way
of life. I would stay clean for a short period, and then I would
use again. First I would just pick up a beer or smoke a joint, but
I would always end up shooting dope again. I couldn't under-
stand it then, today I realize that I still had reservations. There
was still that thought that I could use.
   In the year 1970 I stayed clean for three months two different
times. The last time was right before Christmas, I smoked two
joints and went into convulsions. After that, I took two downs
once and that was it. For almost an entire year I didn't know

132 Narcotics Anonymous


    what it was to be clean again. I drank, took pills, and shot cocaine
    and heroin daily.
      Living on the North Shore made it easy to stay out of trouble.
    There weren't many police in that area. I stayed loaded, my wife
    left and I knew that I would never stay clean again. One time I
    ran out of dope and I shot several hundred milligrams of caffeine
    tablets and went into the shakes for hours. I seemed to be so des-
    perate to die. Although I never woke up in the gutter or on skid
    row, I woke up on the beach, under a palm tree, with my face in
    the sand. The feelings were the same, skid row is in the mind.
      I really feel that it doesn't matter what or how much we use,
    where we live or how much money we have, it's what is going on
    inside that counts. For me, I knew I was dying but still couldn't
    stop. I'd given up on NA, everyone I knew in the program had
    left. My sponsor and a group of clean addicts were in Europe
    and one of the clean addicts was living on another island and
    would call every so often to see if I was still alive.
      On the morning of October 20, 1971, I woke up with dope in
    the house and for some reason I walked out to the beach and
    didn't get loaded the moment I opened my eyes. I remember it
    was a gray, overcast day and I was feeling hopeless. I just sat on
    the beach crying, just wanting to die; I couldn't go on. A feeling
    went through me that I never experienced before in my life. I
    felt warm and peaceful inside. A voice said, "It's over, you never
    have to use again." I felt a peace I had never felt before.
      I returned to the house, packed some stuff and headed for the
    airport. I was going to the island of Maui, where my clean friend
    was. My recovery started with miracles. I had no money, yet I
    was led to the right places at the right times and I got to Maui. I
    walked in and told him that I was ready to go to any lengths to
    stay clean. Staying clean today goes a long way beyond not tak-
    ing that first fix, pill or drink; it is a way of life, a life that I call
    an adventure.

   I have an outline for living, it is the Twelve Steps of NA. I ei-
ther practice and live these steps or I die! I really believe that a
person who stays clean for any amount of time is staying clean
through periods when it seems to make no sense to stay clean. I
feel we all have felt like that at one time or another.
   I've stayed clean by the grace of God. The steps have become
my life. I've had to take many inventories, the Fourth and Fifth
Steps, and I will continue to have to write down what is going
on inside me and give it away.
   For me, this is the way it works; keep giving away the old and
making room for the new. For me, it never gets really easy to do,
usually I have to be backed up against the wall and humiliated
and then I share. They say that this is a program of action, that you
can't keep it without giving it away; how true it is. In the begin-
ning, I thought I had to say all the right things and save everyone.
Today I realize I only have what's in my heart to share. Today, I
can walk into a meeting and if I am full of the Father's love, then I
share it, yet there are times that I walk into a meeting and want to
throw the coffee pot through the window. Yet I have to stay hon-
est, for that's the way I stay clean.
   I know today that staying clean and having a relationship
with God as I understand Him is the most important thing in my
life. When I do that and carry the message to the ones who still
suffer, than all else is provided in my life. I really believe that I
don't have to prove anything to anybody. I carry the message by
letting the newcomer know who I am inside and sharing how I
work the steps one day at a time.
   Since getting clean in 1971, life has been anything but bor-
ing. I have traveled all over. My sponsor was an able example
of following your heart, and that wherever we went, NA was
alive. Our houses were always open, with a coffee pot going.
We started meetings wherever we arrived. Sometimes we had
no money, but we went out to do our primary purpose and God
always showed us the way.

       My sponsor died three years ago with eighteen years clean.
    Most of the group has family now, and we're scattered around
    the United States, learning different lessons, yet NA always
    comes first. Today, I am married and pursue different things
    than during the first seven years of my recovery, yet I know that
    the only way I can have any outside gifts is to put this program
    and God first. We really have found a way up and out, and so
    long as we keep giving it away, no matter if it is love and joy or
    tears and fears, it will be all right.
       Today I live because people are there who care and will listen.
    I really believe in magic, for my life is full of it. God is loving us
    now.

          After a lifetime of using, this "southern gentleman"
       learned that the most gracious thing he could do was open
        the doors to an NA meeting. In this story from our First
          Edition, he recalls that the first time a man told him
              he loved him was in Narcotics Anonymous.


If You Want What We Have

My     name is Bill, and I'm a junkie and a juicer. For many years
of my life I felt that the world had dealt me a cruel hand, which
left me with many inadequate feelings. Fear ate a hole in me that
I was never able to fill with drugs and alcohol.
  I was born in Alabama in 1933. My father's job required con-
stant moving, which meant new schools and new faces. I was
small and sickly and my insecurities and inadequacies around
people increased. I fought these feelings verbally and with my
fists. Punishment in some fashion followed me everywhere.
  My father died when I was seven, and I remember the hate
that I felt because he had left an only child to fend for himself. A
grandmother, aunt and mother spoiled me rotten. Every time the
church door was open, I was there. At the age of ten, everyone in
the family thought baptism was in order. I didn't feel any differ-
ent when I got up than when I knelt down. Control was the name
of the game. I tried to control everyone in our little family and
outside, including the nun who caught me stealing cold drinks
in a convent.
  Another form of punishment that I felt was rejection. My
mother married a man who later proved to be an addict. We
moved to another city, and the war within me intensified. Con-
tinuous fighting at home created more fear and insecurities.
When I was away, I hated my home and resented the people
in it. Drawing upon different concepts, I began another way of
living. It did not matter to me to what lengths I had to go in or-
der to gain love and approval from everyone. Up went the false

                                    135

    front with more dishonesty and deceptions. I was to spend many
    years of my life trying to be something that I was not.
      Relief came at the ripe old age of sixteen in the form of alcohol
    at a dance. Immediately my fear of girls was gone. My two left
    feet disappeared, and I knew exactly when and where to lay my
    newfound wisdom of people. The effect left, and I was back at
    war with me.
      I believed rules were made to be broken. Society's laws were
    not for me. They hampered my way of living, and I began to deal
    with reality the only way I knew, and that was using the drug al-
    cohol. This is the only drug I was aware of in the late forties, and
    I used it to ease the pain. At the time, it was the best way to cope
    with them. Anyone could punch my buttons if I thought that it
    was needed for their approval of me.
      After a small skirmish with school officials and city authori-
    ties, private school was necessary to finish high school. Two
    years of college proved even further that this world, and every-
    thing in it, was full of crap.
      I cared for no one at this stage of the game. However, I met
    a young lady who met all of my requirements. She was from
    an old family, very regal in appearance and possessed all of the
    social graces. We ran off and got married. I entered into a new
    relationship that I was not mature enough to handle.
      I fancied myself in the future as the old southern gentleman,
    broad brim hat, bow string tie, overlooking his vast domain
    with a mint julep in one hand and a gold cane in the other. Mate-
    rial things were the basis for happiness in my life at this time. I
    looked either up or down to people, depending on their seeming
    net worth. After attaining a lot of these things, happiness and
    peace of mind did not come. My salary as purchasing agent at
    a large hospital was not enough. Stealing to support my mate-
    rialistic ambitions was necessary. The salesmen soon found my
    vulnerable spot: wine, women and song. They began to supply
    my demand. Drinking and partying every night soon made a

physical wreck out of me. In the latter part of 1954, I was intro-
duced to a little goodie called codeine by a salesman to draw a
clean breath. Something was cruising in me every moment of
every day.
   I was twenty-one years old and a full-blown addict. Routine
encounters of addicts and alcoholics treated at the hospital con-
vinced me that I was unique. I would never become like they
were.
   The standards and expectations I set for myself and others
were too high to be met. Negative thinking and escapism became
my total personality. Greediness compelled me to study drugs
and experiment. This may have saved my life while I was using.
I feared certain combinations in trying to get off.
   The sixties came along, and I decided I needed a change. I left
the hospital for what I thought were greener pastures and began
to travel. Life was still hell. That old nest of negativism followed
me everywhere that I went. Jobs came and went, then they came
no more. The jails and hospital stays were more frequent and
longer.
   In 1973, I came into a mental ward; I was chained like an ani-
mal. My psychiatrists, who I constantly conned over the years,
knew of my alcohol problem, but not of my other addictions. It
was suggested that I try a Twelve Step Program. My family was
willing to try anything, so off I went for all the wrong reasons.
People were kind and helpful to me, so I began to use them as
I had others all my life. They had never seen me clean and dry,
so how were they to know if I was using. I was very careful not
to talk about too much of anything lest they become suspicious.
Deception and denial were the games that I played and they al-
most killed me. At this time I had gotten off the hard stuff and on
to downers, uppers and mood elevators. People seemed happy
and sober, and I wondered what they were using. I do not believe
there was a fragment of honesty in me at the time. Willingness
to change never crossed my mind. Gambling, women and using

138 Narcotics Anonymous


    were my bag. For over three years I lived in hopelessness and
    despair going back to using, and going back to the program.
       After hearing the Higher Power concept and about a spiritual
    way of life, I knew drugs were not for me. I had at one time a
    God graciously given to me by my environment, whom I did not
    understand. I knew this God did not want anything to do with
    someone like me.
       There were times when I tried to relate, but there seemed to
    be something missing. I sincerely think that even though my
    feelings seemed to be the same as others, there seemed a lack
    of deeper understanding that I needed. God bless them they
    tried. There were no recovering addicts in the area and no NA.
    I looked for people with other drug dependencies and finally
    found one lady in the group. She had spent ten years in and out
    without any success.
       Things did get a little better. There were no arrests and no
    stays in the hospitals for a period of two years. Then, in the fall
    of 1975, everything went to pieces. Back to the hospital I went.
    Exchanging the alcohol for pills, I was back in the old paradox
    again. Then, a series of events began that changed my life. There
    was talk of committing me to the state institution. My family no
    longer wanted me like I was. Two program members came one
    afternoon to see me and they both told me the same thing; that I
    wasn't crazy, to come back, don't use, and ask for help.
       My sponsor, who had fired herself several times from my case,
    picked me up and took me to a meeting. The girl who rode with us
    spoke that night. She talked about God of her understanding. Sit-
    ting next to my wife that night I began to see where I had missed
    the boat. I went back to that dark room and thanked God for those
    people, because somehow I knew they cared. Even though they
    did not understand many things about me, they gave me time
    out of their lives and asked for nothing back. I remembered the
    Eleventh Step in the program and I thought maybe, just maybe, if
    I asked for knowledge of His will for me and the power to carry

                                                           Beginnings 139


it out, He might help. I got a little brave, I knew that I wasn't hon-
est, I added, "P.S., Please help me get honest." It would be great
to say that I left that hospital and never used again, but it didn't
happen that way. It was almost like all the other confinements I
had experienced. I came out of that hospital with exactly what I
went in with: me!
   Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's passed just like a
wink, blink and a nod, and I was still praying. Everything got
worse. My family kicked me out the day after New Year's. I
knew it was hopeless, but I was still asking for honesty. On or
around the fifth of January, I began to ease off the pills I was us-
ing. It wasn't any fun, but I know today that all the suffering was
necessary. Praying and tapering off had become my obsessions.
I felt that this was my last chance.
   I took my last pill, shot, etc., in March. By God's grace I was
clean! People began to tell me, look what you have done, and I
began to believe them. I got to looking so good to me that I just
invited me out for a drink. What a rude awakening. I came off
that drunk cold turkey, no pills, nothing, for the first time in
over twenty-one years. For five days I shook and I mean shook.
On the fifth day, I wanted no more. I sat down in my little V.W.,
bowed my head and told God, "If this is all in life for me, I want
life no longer. Death would be far more merciful. It doesn't make
any difference any longer." I felt a peace come into me that I had
never felt. I don't know how long this lasted, and it doesn't mat-
ter. It happened and that is the important part. Since then, I have
experienced the same feeling from time to time. It was like being
brought forward from darkness to light. God doesn't let me stay
in the sunlight too long, but He will help me if I choose to stay
in the twilight. I walked away from that car a free man. I did not
realize this for a long time. Since that day, I have not had a desire
to use.
   A God of my understanding had sent me enough honesty to
get started down the right path. I went back to the program and

    again I made another mistake. I kept my mouth shut with the
    intention of letting the winners teach me how to become clean.
    Today I know that for me I walked a different path through ad-
    diction, and I had to walk a different path through this program.
    I had to learn about me. For almost two years in the program, I
    saw people come and go with addictions other than alcohol. One
    night in Birmingham, I was sharing with a group and also talk-
    ing about drugs when a man approached me with tears in his
    eyes. He told me of his son and daughter somewhere hooked on
    drugs. He said, "Surely God must have some program for peo-
    ple like them." All the way back home that night I talked to a girl
    using drugs, a schoolmate of my wife. The telephone gave us the
    answer through some new friends from Georgia and Tennessee
    in Narcotics Anonymous. Avisit to share in Chattanooga proved
    to be a blessing. Several people came up from Atlanta, includ-
    ing one guy from Marietta who kept telling people that he loved
    them. I was forty-four years of age at the time, that was the first
    time a man had ever told me that he loved me. For some unex-
    plainable reason, I also felt his love. Acouple of months later, we
    went to Atlanta and found a repetition of our first trip. I wanted
    so much to give and feel as these people did. At the close of the
    dance that night, I overheard something that went like this, "If
    you want what we have, you have got to take the steps."
      I came back to Alabama and began to take the steps. I learned
    about me and found a God of my understanding. Trust God,
    Clean House, Help Others, explains it as simply as I can. I spent
    many years looking for something around the corner, or some-
    one coming down the street who would give me happiness and
    peace of mind. Today, through the steps and the people in NA, I
    have found a solution. I have to stay honest with me, stay open-
    minded enough to change and be willing to accept God's love for
    me through the members of NA.
      I am very grateful to our brothers and sisters in Georgia for
    their tolerance and support during our first year or so in the

program in Alabama. They more or less sponsored me in those
early days. Just knowing they were there was very comforting.
Many times I called my friend in Marietta, despondent over the
way things were going. He always seemed to have the answer.
Keep the doors open and God will do the rest.
   NA groups now have sprung up in several cities and now
those people are sponsoring me through their growth in NAand
God's grace. I finally got it all together, but without God's help I
forget where I put it.
   There is one thing that I feel I can give to every addict to use.
I love each and every one of you, and most importantly, God
loves you too! I found this love in the wonderful Program of NA,
through God's grace and you people. Come join us; it works!

    In this story originally published in our Little White Book and
    added to the Basic Text at the Second Edition, a mother learns
     that she can come out of the paralyzing fear of addiction and
    turn her whole life around. She claims her seat as a woman in
      NA and hopes that one day more women will find recovery.

Fearful Mother

I thought an addict was a person who was using hard drugs,
someone who was on the streets or in jail. My pattern was dif-
ferent--I got my drugs from a doctor. I knew something was
wrong yet I tried to do right--at work, in my marriage and in
raising my children. I really tried hard. I would be doing well
and then I'd fail. It went on like this and each time it seemed like
forever; it seemed like nothing would ever change. I wanted to
be a good mother. I wanted to be a good wife. I wanted to be in-
volved in society yet never felt a part of it.
  I went through years of telling my children "I'm sorry but
this time it will be different." I went from one doctor to another
asking for help. I went for counseling feeling everything will be
all right now, but the inside was still saying, "What is wrong?"
I was changing jobs, changing doctors, changing drugs, trying
different books, religions and hair colors. I moved from one area
to another, changed friends and moved furniture. I went on va-
cations and also remained hidden in my home--so many things
through the years--constantly feeling, I'm wrong, I'm different,
I'm a failure.
  When I had my first child I liked it when they knocked me
out; I liked the feeling of the drugs they gave me. It was a feeling
that whatever is going on around me, I don't know and I don't
care, really. Through the years the tranquilizers gave me the feel-
ing that nothing is really that important. Toward the end, things
became so mixed up I was not sure what was and what was not
important. I was shaking inside and out. Drugs would not help.

  I was still trying, but very little. I had quit work and was trying
to go back but I couldn't. I would be on the couch afraid of ev-
erything. I was 103 pounds and had sores on my lips and in my
nose. I had diabetes and shook so that I had a hard time putting
a spoon to my mouth. I felt I was out to kill myself and people
around me were out to hurt me. Physically and mentally I had
a breakdown. I had just become a grandmother and I could not
even communicate with a small child. I was almost a vegetable.
I wanted to be a part of living but did not know how. Part of me
said I'd be better off dead and part of me said there has to be a
better way of living.
  When I started on the Program of NA, there were a lot of peo-
ple who suggested just everyday things for me to do, like eating,
taking a bath, getting dressed, going for a walk, going to meet-
ings. They told me, "Don't be afraid, we have all gone through
this." I went to a lot of meetings through the years. One thing has
stuck with me, one thing they said from the beginning, "Betty,
you can stop running and you can be whatever you want to be
and do whatever you want to do."
  Since being on the program I have listened and watched many
people and have seen them go through many ups and downs. I
have used the teachings I felt were best for me. My work area
has had to change and I have been going to school. I have had to
relearn all the way back to the grammar school level. It has been
slow for me but very rewarding.
  I also decided that I need to know me better before I can have
a meaningful relationship with a man. I am learning to com-
municate with my daughters. I am trying many things which I
wanted to do for years. I am able to remember many things that
I had pushed out of my mind. I have found that Betty is not that
big pile of nothing but is someone and something that I never
really stopped to look at or listen to. April 1, will be my fifth NA
birthday. How's that for April Fool's day!

144 Narcotics Anonymous


       I have been asked to update my story. This April 1, will be
    my tenth year birthday. I think, "Where have I been and have I
                              5

    really grown?" I know that I have gotten married. I would like
    to say I love my husband very dearly, and at times this is hard
    for me to say. Expressing a deep feeling for any person has been
    very hard for me. I have felt like it would be taken away, or that
    he would hurt me or laugh at me. That has happened at times,
    but I have still loved him and it has not been that big and crush-
    ing a deal. I am learning not to put him or myself on a pedestal.
    If I am expecting too much of him that means I had better look
    a little closer at myself. There are times when we can talk, and
    there are times it takes time before we can talk. How boring if
    we both thought alike and everything went smoothly or if we
    fought constantly.
       I still get feelings of running away from home, and maybe
    going back to the Islands or Michigan. I have been living in the
    same place for almost four years. I think that is a record for me. I
    am still moving furniture around. I love it and would like to put
    everything on rollers, it would be a lot easier.
       I still do not understand men. Every once in a while I tell my
    husband that I am a woman and I need to be taken to a movie
    or somewhere. I am learning to verbalize my needs to another
    person. I also go to the show alone once in a while.
       I graduated from high school two years ago. I would love to
    graduate from college, maybe some time in the future. Every-
    one needs something to look forward to. My daughter, son-in-
    law and granddaughter gave me a violin for Christmas. When I
    was in grammar school I took lessons for a very short time. The
    school stopped giving lessons and took back their violin and I
    never forgot that. I started out this year by slowly taking lessons
    and I became obsessed. I was going to two teachers and study-
    ing out of three different books. I found myself looking at one of
    my books and saying, "Where am I?" So now I am back to one
    teacher and one book.

   I had a breast operated on and they removed part of it. I will
not say this was a whiz because it wasn't, but I was luckier than
some. I had the NA Program and people to walk through it with
me. I cannot say my life has been like tiptoeing through the tu-
lips, because that is not reality. I can say that my life is now get-
ting better and I am more open to looking and walking in reality.
With the world in such a turmoil, I feel I have been blessed to be
where I am.
   I look at how NA has grown. We are in Germany, Australia,
England, Scotland, Italy, Brazil, etc. Maybe some day we will
reach the countries that are so damn hard to reach.
   I have been told there are not many women with a lot of time
on the program. I am surprised when I hear this. I just assume
there are and maybe they have moved to other cities and states.
Maybe even to some of these countries that are so damn hard to
reach. When a woman wants something bad enough, look out,
she can move heaven and hell. One of the first things said to me
was, "No one else in this world knows what you want, but you.
If you want to survive in this world you had better do what is
right for you, because no one else is going to do it." I get bumps
and bruises and I suck my thumb once in awhile, but I sure get
stronger each time.
   I have a dog named Baba Wawa, she was very tiny when my
daughter gave her to me. My daughter said, "Mom, here is a
little dog and she will never grow very large." Well, she has
grown very big and she surprises me every once in a while. Last
night she tried to fight a big dog right through a chain link fence.
I thought she was still a puppy, but she can stand her own. I
guess it's like me. I have grown more than I realized and, unlike
Baba Wawa, I have been known to climb the fence and go after
whatever I want. I have also been known to knock those fences
down. I feel like there is more to say, but who can put all of ten
years down on paper? I would rather spend my time living it
than writing it.

    or what I said, but I feel good. What I am trying to say is, "Thank

     This addict found freedom behind bars through the Fellowship
    of Narcotics Anonymous. This is a story from our First Edition.

Jails, Institutions,
and Recovery

Ifirst came to Narcotics Anonymous in a state prison. It was my
third term in prison over a seven year period, with only a few
months at any one time in the streets.
   One night in this prison I heard of a meeting going on about
something to do with drugs. Well, I could relate to this, so I de-
cided to check it out. Besides, it would get me away from the cell
for a while.
   I can remember how confused I was leaving the first meeting.
Back in my cell, I dwelled on all those years in and out of jails and
all the things that I'd been through just to get loaded. Most of all,
I began thinking of how tired I was of living this kind of life. This
group called Narcotics Anonymous seemed then to be a little too
much for me. I told myself that I wasn't a hardcore dope fiend,
but just a guy who liked to get loaded every day and a thief
who could not stay out of jail. Although in those first meetings
I did not see NA as a solution to my craziness, I did hear some
things I could relate to. So, I kept going back. I heard the people
in NA say that they didn't take drugs anymore, not even grass.
I listened. Sure I wanted to stop all the insane situations in my
life, but I didn't think I had to give up drugs altogether to do it. I
thought that I needed to learn how to handle drugs better.
   Some of the NA members, who came into the prison to share
at these meetings, had been inmates themselves. They attributed
the change in their lives to the support of Narcotics Anonymous;
one addict sharing and helping another addict. I enjoyed hear-
ing these people tell how it was and how it is today and soon felt
a real kinship in the pain that we had all been through. I began


                                  147

148 Narcotics Anonymous


    respecting these people in NAwho talked about how they found
    a way to live without drugs, alcohol, and jails.
       I continued to get stoned in the institution whenever and
    whatever way I could while still attending NA meetings regu-
    larly. The members told me to keep coming back no matter what,
    so I did. Besides, it sure beat talking that talk in the yard.
       Soon I was to be transferred for pre-release to a much looser
    security prison. I had been there before and had been busted for
    smoking grass, for which I was sent to a more maximum prison.
    Now, as I was packing my property for this transfer, I remem-
    bered a lot of trouble I had gotten into at this institution, just to
    use drugs. The Man knew me there, and I was pretty nervous
    now, thinking about being eye-balled from the time I stepped off
    that bus. I was already thinking hard about getting loaded when
    I could and scared stiff inside knowing what would happen if I
    got caught again.
       So I smoked a joint that morning before the long bus ride. I
    didn't know it then, but it was to be my last. Back in the begin-
    ning, when I was attending these NA meetings, I would wonder
    why it wasn't working for me like it did for others. I was tired of
    this drug and institutional life, but at that point I guess I wasn't
    tired enough, because I was still using when I was going to the
    meetings. I had a decision to make on that bus ride which was
    paid for by the Department of Corrections. The decision I made
    that day was mostly out of fear and some things I heard in those
    first NA meetings.
       I remember being in that bus, moving down the highway with
    chains wrapped around my waist and shackles on my feet, un-
    comfortably looking up at a resentful guard behind a cage with a
    shotgun. Staring out the window as the miles of freedom passed
    me by, I wondered why I couldn't be a part of that world. Getting
    loaded did not feel right anymore. Yet thinking about not taking
    anything sure felt strange. What a relief, when later I learned
    that it was easier by doing it just one day at a time.

   Upon arrival at this other prison I was met by an inmate who
was an NA member. I knew him from meetings that we both at-
tended at another prison. It really made a difference to see his
face when I drove up because, again, I knew I had the support
that would help me make it. I continued in the fellowship at this
prison and became active in the service part of the program in
the institution.
   During these last six months I had to do on my sentence, I
would wake up in the morning and say, "Just for today, I won't
take anything," and I hung with NA people in the institution to
keep myself away from temptation. There were plenty of op-
portunities, so it wasn't easy, but I now had the support of the
NA Fellowship. Once I was let out to attend an outside meeting,
which made me want the Fellowship on the outside even more.
I started going to the meetings clean for the first time and some-
thing happened. The program began to work.
   Today I know what makes NA work. One really starts under-
standing why it can work only when totally abstaining from all
mind-altering chemicals.
   I also was beginning to understand what caring means; by
helping each other, we can make it. I felt that the only one who
really understood me was another addict. And the only one who
could help was a clean addict.
   I was so proud to stand before the group in prison and an-
nounce that I had ninety days clean. Feeling proud was not part
of my life before NA. It was such a relief, not having to hustle
drugs out on the yard, and do the crazy things that I did to get
high. I had never done time like this and it sure felt great.
   I made another decision through the advice the NA members
gave me, which was the second most important decision I had
ever made in my life. This decision was to have someone from
the NA Program at the gate to pick me up when I was released.
Aperson that I knew understood what I needed my first day out,
because I sure didn't at this point.

150 Narcotics Anonymous


       When I go back into prisons today to carry the message of
    Narcotics Anonymous, I suggest that inmates have an NA
    member at that gate when they get out. I heard so many say, "Oh,
    I'll check it out, but I've gotta do this first, or be here first." Don't
    kid yourself; you might die first if you are an addict like me.
       That first day out was so righteous. I was taken to a home
    where NA members were expecting me. This one member gave
    me a new address book with NA phone numbers in it and said,
    "Give me your old address book, you don't need those old num-
    bers of your connections anymore." Another member took me
    to his closet, and gave me some clothes. I went to a bunch of
    meetings that day, and sure received the love and care I needed,
    which seemed to make up for all the attention I missed while
    locked up over the years.
       Recently, one of the many benefits, for me, was being able to
    stand before the judge of the Superior Court and receive my Cer-
    tificate of Rehabilitation. I never thought I would be standing in
    front of any judge for this reason. I am so grateful today to say
    that I have been able to go beyond the Fellowship for the support
    I need. I'm speaking about God. I mean a God I can understand
    and talk to when I need a Higher Strength, the God I found in
    Narcotics Anonymous.
       So, if you are in a cell reading this, my message goes to you. If
    you are wondering whether drugs or booze, or both are screw-
    ing up your life, find out where an NA meeting is in your facility
    and check it out. You might be saving your own life, and learning
    a better way. If one addict can make it, so can another. We help
    each other in Narcotics Anonymous.

        Not all addicts reach jails or institutions in order to hit
       their bottom. In his story, originally published in the Little
       White Book and later included in our Second Edition, this
     "different" addict explains that his disease kept him confined
           to a life of fear and loneliness. He found serenity in
                  a simple life in Narcotics Anonymous.


I Was Different

   My story may differ from the others you have heard, in that
I was never arrested or hospitalized. I did, however, reach the
point of utter despair which so many of us have experienced. It is
not my track record that shows my addiction but rather my feel-
ings and my life. Addiction was my way of life--the only way of
life I knew for many years.
   Thinking back, I must have taken one look at life and
decided I didn't want any part of it. I came from a "good old-
fashioned," upper-middle-class broken home. I can't remember
a time when I haven't been strung out. As a small child, I found
out I could ease the pain with food, and here my drug addiction
began.
   I became part of the pill mania of the 1950's. Even at this time
I found it hard to take medication as directed. I figured that two
pills would do twice as much good as one. I remember hoard-
ing pills, stealing from my mother's prescriptions, having a hard
time making the pills last until the next refill.
   I continued to use in this way throughout my early years.
When I was in high school and the drug craze hit, the transition
between drugstore dope and street dope was a natural. I had
already been using drugs on a daily basis for nearly ten years;
these drugs had virtually stopped working. I was plagued
with adolescent feelings of inadequacy and inferiority. The
only answer I had was that if I took something I either was,
felt or acted better.

                                     151

152 Narcotics Anonymous


       The story of my street using is pretty normal. I used anything
    and everything available every day. It didn't matter what I took
    so long as I got high. Drugs seemed good to me in those years. I
    was a crusader; I was an observer; I was afraid; and I was alone.
    Sometimes I felt all-powerful and sometimes I prayed for the
    comfort of idiocy--if only I didn't have to think. I remember feel-
    ing different--not quite human--and I couldn't stand it. I stayed
    in my natural state...loaded.
       In 1966, I think, I got turned on to heroin. After that, like so
    many of us, nothing else would do the thing for me. At first I
    joy-popped occasionally, and then used only on weekends; but a
    year later I had a habit, and two years later I flunked out of col-
    lege and started working where my connection worked. I used
    stuff and dealt, and ran for another year-and-a-half before I got
    "sick and tired of being sick and tired."
       I found myself strung out and no longer able to function as a
    human being. During this last year of my using, I started looking
    for help. Nothing worked! Nothing helped!
       Somewhere along the line I had gotten the telephone number
    of a man in NA. Against my better judgment and without hope,
    I made what may well be the most important phone call of my
    life.
       No one came to save me; I wasn't instantly cured. The man
    simply said that if I had a drug problem, I might benefit from the
    meetings. He gave me the address of a meeting for that night. It
    was too far to drive, and besides I was kicking. He also gave me
    the address of another meeting a couple of days later and closer
    to home. I promised him I'd go and have a look. When the night
    came, I was deathly afraid of getting busted, and afraid of the
    dope fiends I would find there. I knew I wasn't like the addict you
    read about in books or newspapers. Despite these fears I made
    my first meeting. I was dressed in a three piece black suit, black
    tie, and eighty-four hours off a two-and-a-half year run. I didn't
    want you to know what and who I was. I don't think I fooled

                                                          Beginnings 153


anybody, I was screaming for help, and everybody knew it. I really
don't remember much of that first meeting, but I must have heard
something that brought me back. The first feeling I do remember
on this program was the gnawing fear that because I'd never been
busted or hospitalized for drugs, I might not qualify and might
not be accepted.
   I used twice during my first two weeks around the program,
and finally gave up. I no longer cared whether or not I qualified,
I didn't care if I was accepted, I didn't even care what the people
thought of me. I was too tired to care.
   I don't remember exactly when, but shortly after I gave up, I
began to get some hope that this program might work for me. I
started to imitate some of the things the winners were doing. I
got caught up in NA. I felt good, it was great to be clean for the
first time in years.
   After I'd been around for about six months, the novelty of be-
ing clean wore off, and I fell off that rosy cloud I'd been riding.
It got hard. Somehow I survived that first dose of reality. I think
the only things I had going for me then were the desire to stay
clean, no matter what; faith that things would work out okay so
long as I didn't use; and people who were willing to help when
I asked for help. Since then, it's been an uphill fight; I've had to
work to stay clean. I've found it necessary to go to many meet-
ings, to work with newcomers, to participate in NA, to get in-
volved. I've had to work the Twelve Steps the best I could, and
I've had to learn to live.
   Today, my life is much simpler. I have a job I like, I'm comfort-
able in my marriage, I have real friends, and I'm active in NA.
This type of life seems to suit me fine. I used to spend my time
looking for the magic--those people, places, and things, which
would make my life ideal. I no longer have time for magic. I'm
too busy learning how to live. It's a long slow process. Some-
times I think I'm going crazy. Sometimes I think "What's the
use." Sometimes I back myself into that corner of self-obsession

154 Narcotics Anonymous


    and think there's no way out. Sometimes I think I can't stand
    life's problems anymore, but then this program provides an an-
    swer and the bad times pass.
       Most of the time life's pretty good.And sometimes life is great,
    greater than I can ever remember. I learned to like myself and
    found friendship. I came to know myself a little bit and found
    understanding. I found a little faith, and from it, freedom. And
    I found service and learned that this provides the fulfillment I
    need for happiness.

Reflections

When     I finally had a moment of honest reflection about the se-
verity of my drug addiction, I'd already been through the loss of
relationships, jobs, esteem, credibility, and personal morality. I
was experiencing deep spiritual chaos.
   I asked myself, "What ever happened to all that joy and hap-
piness I used to feel?"
   One night I ran into one of my old using friends. To my sur-
prise, he was drug-free. We spoke awhile and he let me stay with
him that night. He introduced me to recovery. There was an NA
group four blocks away, and I started attending daily. Soon I was
asked to serve as the GSR alternate, and I realized my life had
taken another direction. I was no longer that same lost person.



I went  to my first rehab at twelve years old, just after I started
doing drugs. Even though I disliked the feeling of being high, I
kept using. I used drugs that I said I would never use. I thought
about suicide every day and stuck a shotgun in my mouth at
fourteen but couldn't pull the trigger. I was a convicted felon at
fifteen and hated my life.
   I used for about two and a half years in all. I stopped while I
was in rehab for the third time, and I still felt miserable. I needed
an answer. I was introduced to NAagain in that rehab. I'd grown
tired of living in and creating more pain. I wanted relief.
   We read from the Basic Text, and this time I believed it. I started
feeling that I was on a path that could lead me out of my pain. The
day I left treatment, I went directly to a meeting. They told me they
loved me and that they wanted me to keep coming back.And I did.

    Even   here in prison, my life can be peaceful, orderly, and use-
    ful. And by the grace of God I am making progress. At the end
    of my using, I was arrested for robbery. Though I knew I was an
    addict, I wouldn't admit it. Getting high was the only relief I felt I
    could get, but it was becoming less effective and producing more
    problems. Here, I connected with a sponsor by mail. He encour-
    ages me and helps me work the steps. I've learned to just follow
    directions as best I can.



    My    addiction progressed to the point where I couldn't speak
    in complete sentences. My mind was fractured, and I wouldn't
    sleep for days at a time. I began to take to heart what I learned
    in treatment--go to NA meetings. I threw myself into recovery,
    and I got a sponsor who taught me to laugh and have fun again
    without using.



    My    mother picked me up at the treatment center that had just
    kicked me out. She did not speak a word until we were a block
    from home, where she pulled over and said she loved me and
    wanted me to give this recovery thing a try. She might have said
    those words every day of my life for all I knew. But it was the first
    time I actually heard her say it, and I believed it when she said,
    "I love you." I had a glimmer of hope.
      I'd known that there were recovery programs available and
    had met some of the NAmembers at the youth center on Wednes-
    days. They were an odd group that reminded me of hippies from
    the sixties. They often hung around and talked with us kids after
    the meetings. But it was the readings that hooked me in, talking
    about the disease of addiction, not a specific drug. It wasn't long
    before I found my place in recovery in Narcotics Anonymous.
    Today I am able to look for similarities, instead of being distrac-

                                                    Coming Home 159


ted by differences. This group of people took me in, and it was
like being adopted by fifty older brothers and sisters.



The   last night I used, I blacked out. When I came to, my car
was parked sideways in the driveway and there was a bag of
money on the coffee table. I thought I had robbed someone, but
I couldn't remember. I knew inside I was through. I saw the sun
rise and thought to myself, "I'm done getting high. Now what
do I do?"
   I'd heard of NA from a friend who had six months clean, and
I went to a meeting. I approached a guy in front of the meet-
ing place. I asked him if this was Narcotics Anonymous, and he
hugged me. I didn't know what to think of that, but it didn't feel
bad. I heard a lot at that meeting and some of it made sense. Feel-
ings surfaced that I'd stuffed for years, and tears welled in my
eyes when I heard the reading Just for Today. Some of the people
even seemed happy. I met a man who had a calmness I wanted,
and he agreed to sponsor me. I feel so lucky to have found NA.



At   the end of my using, I was in detox for six days. I felt very
shaky for a few weeks longer from the physical withdrawal. In
former times I'd have written a prescription for myself and easily
started the addiction cycle over again. Something was prevent-
ing me from doing what I'd always done. I was going to meetings
every day and loved hearing addicts share about having good
lives. I got a sponsor in my first weeks and called her every day.
She encouraged me to get involved with service and started me
on the steps right away. My brains were a bit scrambled at first,
but she felt step work was an excellent way to help unscramble
them. She was right.

    Despite   the warm welcome I got at my first NA meeting, I felt
    very uncomfortable there. I always got panicky in the face of
    the unknown. Being an expert in justification, I told myself that
    I was too young. The worst thing is that I believed myself! My
    disease continued to progress for two more years. One day, after
    a twenty-four-hour run, feeling desperate, I returned home to
    find the pamphlet Youth and Recovery on my nightstand. I was     6

    in tears when I opened it. I felt so worn out. I started going to
    meetings, and although they didn't calm my fears at first, I kept
    coming back. I grew fascinated by the new language: acceptance,
    humility, amends, open-mindedness, and Higher Power. Thanks
    to NA, I felt I was finally going to learn how to live, and I realized
    I had so much to learn.

     He checked himself into treatment to avoid prison, but while
       he was there he found hope in the pages of a Basic Text.
      There was no NA in his part of rural Illinois, so he started
          a meeting and he's stayed clean through his own
              growing pains and those of the fellowship.


Start a Meeting,
They Will Come

I was forty-five years old, two prison terms behind me, facing
twelve to sixty years on this latest possession charge. I was still
using, going to an outpatient treatment center to fool everyone
so I wouldn't have to go back to prison. Well, it worked! The con
fooled them again, and I ended up with probation. If I could
just get around all the drug tests, my problems would be over.
Just my luck: I caught a dirty drop. Why didn't God answer my
prayers? I only asked that He would help me pass the drug test.
This time I really had to work a big con, so I admitted myself into
an inpatient treatment center. I didn't need treatment, of course,
but I had to make the law think I really wanted help.
  The best thing that happened to me in treatment was that my
counselor gave me a Basic Text from Narcotics Anonymous. I
could hardly put it down once I started reading it. It seemed like
this book was written about me. For the first time, I felt hope.
The Basic Text was like a map to help me find a way out and
build a new life. Even though I had only been clean for about
two weeks, I made two decisions: I was going to become a mem-
ber of Narcotics Anonymous, and I was going to start a meeting
in my hometown. With the hope given to me from reading the
Basic Text, I truly believed that a Narcotics Anonymous meeting
would get addicts clean.
  I come from a small town in Illinois, and across the river is an-
other small town. There were a number of meetings for the AA
Fellowship, but no NA meetings at all. I told my counselor that

                                 161

162 Narcotics Anonymous


    I was going to start an NA meeting back home when I got out of
    treatment. He told me that I wouldn't be able to get it done, and
    that I should go to a halfway house instead. But I'm stubborn, so
    I didn't listen.
      I got clean in June, was released from treatment the first week
    of July, and on 3 August 2000 we had our first Narcotics Anony-
    mous meeting! It was slow getting started. There were only a
    couple of us for the first few months, but we persevered. Word
    got out that there was a new meeting. Members came over from
    Iowa to help us through their outreach service. One of them
    brought us the steps and traditions posters and other readings. I
    was so grateful. This is when I first realized how much love that
    the NA Fellowship has to offer.
      These meetings didn't just happen by sheer luck. We have had
    our share of growing pains. Picture a room with ten to fifteen ad-
    dicts, all on the First Step, with no experienced sponsorship for
    direction. Talk about being powerless and unmanageable! And
    we all thought we knew everything. We made every mistake
    you can imagine. Relapses were common. Arguments occurred
    over members bringing bibles and other non-NA material to
    meetings. Then there were the dating games, which caused new
    resentments and even some relapses. The hardest thing for me
    was that many of the addicts who came shortly after I did kept
    looking to me for direction. Heck, I was on the First Step too!
      Remember, we are in rural Illinois, not Chicago. The large
    metropolitan areas with established NA communities were at
    least sixty miles away, and might as well have been on the other
    side of the world. If you had an issue with other members, there
    weren't any other meetings to attend so you could avoid each
    other. You either worked through your resentment or went out
    and used. We had only one meeting.
      I realized that if this was going to work and I was going to
    survive, then I had to take action. I started attending a group
    out of town, found a sponsor, and got some help. Thank God for

                                                      Coming Home 163


sponsorship. When we reached out for help, recovering addicts
came to share their experience, strength, and hope with us. As a
result, we learned better ways to work the program and carry the
NA message. After five years, we are still making mistakes, but
we survived and are getting stronger. In the past year we have
joined an area service committee. We travel every month to other
NA communities and now receive more support from "out-of-
towners." As our members got more stable in their recovery, we
started doing the same type of outreach service that had helped
our group in its early stages. As a result, there are now several
active NAgroups within a thirty-mile radius of our home group.
This is another great experience because we are truly giving
away what was so freely given to us.
   Our area holds an annual convention and a few other big
events. This is a good opportunity for our small NA fellowship
to experience the benefits of being a part of greater NA, so we of-
ten have caravans of addicts cruising on a "recovery quest." The
interaction with addicts I don't see as often helps me experience
the importance of the phrase "principles before personalities":
When I come back home, I try harder to look past the flaws in
others. Hopefully they are learning to forgive my shortcomings
as well.
   The Twelve Steps of Narcotics Anonymous have helped me to
change from the inside to become a better man. I feel the most
spiritual when I let my Higher Power work through me to help
another suffering addict. One of the greatest blessings that I re-
ceive as a Narcotics Anonymous member is seeing newcomers
arrive all beat up and scared, not knowing what to do, doubting
if this will work for them, and then seeing them start to change.
They surrender, begin sharing honestly, and get the light of re-
covery in their eyes as they work through the steps.
   NAis alive and well in rural Illinois, thanks, in part, to a coun-
selor lending a Basic Text to a con. I have learned a new way of

    have imagined. At this writing I have over five years clean, and
    our home group just celebrated its fifth birthday picnic. My home
    group has held over 3,600 meetings. Just for today, through NA,
    many addicts are living the promise of freedom from active ad-
    diction in our area. For this I will remain forever grateful. If you
    start a meeting, they will come!

     This addict from the "wrong side" of Chicago's south side lost
       his best friend and his marriage to the disease of addiction.
     Recovery hasn't restored the things he's lost, but it has helped
                           him make amends.

The Point

My     sponsor says this is an example of "God showing off." I'll
tell you the story and let you decide.
   My best friend's mom never liked that we hung out together.
She'd tell him not to bring "that curly-headed boy" to the house.
I lived on the wrong side of Chicago's south side; he lived in a
neighborhood favored by the folks who wanted a better and
safer environment for their children. But he and I were tight, and
we did most everything together. We were both adopted, and we
looked and felt like the brothers we never had.
   I joined the army at the tender underage of sixteen. My home
life was insane. The family that adopted me, a half-black baby,
from a German orphanage had become a pretty dysfunctional
alcoholic scene. My second stepdad used to beat my mom in
drunken stupors, and then she'd beat me. One day, following a
particularly brutal display of codependent relationship dynam-
ics, I came to the conclusion that if this was love, you could have
my share. I knew that I could no longer live in that house.
   I walked into an army recruiter's office on a Thursday, and
Sunday night I was in Fort Polk, Louisiana. Five months later I
was injecting heroin in Amsterdam, Holland. Four months after
that I was honorably discharged--I had told them I was under-
age. It had become too hard to keep up a heroin habit and do the
duties the army expected every day.
   I came back to Chicago and started going to college. My friend
and I became roommates. The winter of 1975 was cold. The no-
torious Chicago winds were blowing hard, and the temperature
was below zero every day. On the day after Christmas we were


                                  165

    in our basement apartment with our coats on to fend off the cold,
    watching television and smoking weed.Atropical scene came on
    the screen showing sunny California with the beach, palm trees,
    and a beautiful woman driving a convertible Mercedes. I looked
    out our window, then looked at the TV and told my friend,
    "Enough of this weather; I'm going to California." He immedi-
    ately agreed, and we left Chicago that weekend to pursue all the
    promise that sunny California offered. We arrived in San Fran-
    cisco on a cold, wet, windy January afternoon. It was nothing
    like the TV show; it was almost as cold as Chicago. I wondered
    if I had made a mistake.
       Nevertheless, we made the best of it and settled into our new
    life. He decided to go to college and work on a degree. I decided
    to immerse myself in the huge underground drug scene. My
    life became as our literature describes: I "lived to use and used
    to live." I was going in and out of jail, and my friend was con-
    tinuing in his education. He had hooked up with a nice little
    square girlfriend. I had a girlfriend too, but she certainly wasn't
    a square. She was my using buddy, and together our addictions
    flourished.
       In 1982 my son was born. He was the answer to my prayers:
    Having been adopted, I had never known anyone who was
    blood-related to me. I wanted to be a good dad, but my addic-
    tion would not allow anyone or anything to come before it. I had
    a primal need to use, every day, at any cost. I remember how
    guilty I felt when my son walked into a room and I had a belt
    wrapped around my arm, or when he fell asleep waiting for me
    to come out of the bathroom, where I was nodding off. He meant
    the world to me, and this was the best I could do.
       One day that same friend called me to hook up and get high.
    He was a closet addict. He impersonated a square in the daytime
    and would occasionally come to my dark side of the world at
    night and use. There was some dope on the street at the time that
    was overdosing people, and I copped a few bags for us. We both

                                                       Coming Home 167


shot up, and we both passed out. I woke up and looked over to
see my friend still out. I tried to revive him, but he wouldn't come
to. I staggered to the lobby and asked someone to call 911. The
ambulance came and took him to the general hospital.
  They took him out like they were taking out garbage. I guess
they had seen so many addicts that they had lost any semblance
of compassion. The cop looked disgusted as he asked me if I
wanted to come along. I told him I would be there shortly. I went
back to the room and did another shot. That is the insanity of my
disease. I woke up about six hours later with a needle hanging
out of my arm.
  I remembered that I had to pick up my friend from the hospi-
tal. When I called from the lobby to find out which room he was
in, I was informed that he had died. I couldn't believe it; I loved
him, and he was gone. I felt so bad and guilty for my role in his
death. I couldn't understand why God would let him die instead
of me. Actually, I thought that God was reaching for me and
picked him by mistake. I was devastated. I called his girlfriend,
and I can still hear her screaming into the phone.
  My addiction became suicidal. I overdosed all the time, always
disappointed that I woke up. I remember crossing the street so
people who knew me wouldn't see how low I had gotten. All I
did was use, but I couldn't use enough to make the pain go away.
And I didn't know there was another way. I didn't know that
addicts like me got clean. No one came to the Tenderloin area
of San Francisco to twelve-step any of us. I had no clue about
Narcotics Anonymous.
  One morning I was sitting on the dock of the San Francisco
Bay in a "deuce and a quarter" that I never put more than $2.00
worth of gas in. It was about 5:30 am. My three-year-old son
                  7

was in the back seat, and his mom was in the front seat, beg-
ging me to get them something to eat. All night long I had been
shooting speedballs of heroin and cocaine. I knew that once I
shot up, we would need to go get more money to use. She didn't

    know that we were broke, since we started the night with over
    $600. I wrapped the belt around my arm, and looked in the rear-
    view mirror. I told my son to turn over, because the rule was
    he couldn't watch me shoot up. He looked lovingly at me and
    smiled. And then I looked in the mirror at myself and had the
    proverbial "moment of clarity."
      I saw what I had become. My teeth and eyes were yellow, my
    face was broken out, my hands were swollen with track marks all
    over them, there was blood on my jeans, and my neck was green
    from wearing a fake gold necklace. I was a mess. Then I looked
    again at my son. He was peeking at me, smiling. And I knew: I
    knew that if I kept using he didn't have a chance. I knew I would
    never teach him how to drive, or play baseball, or tie a tie, or get
    ready for the prom, or ride a bike. I didn't care about my own life,
    but I realized that it wasn't fair to deny him a life. I looked at his
    mom and realized that she had been following me everywhere,
    and I was leading her right to hell. Then I did something that I
    think nearly every recovering addict can remember, probably
    right to the moment. I cried out, "God help me." That was the first
    time I genuinely asked for my Higher Power's help to stop. I had
    wanted to stop for years, but didn't know how. That cry for help
    didn't have an immediate reaction that I could see. I finished off
    my drugs and convinced my sobbing girlfriend that we needed
    to go get some money to use again.
      I know now that God's delay is not God's denial. I was ar-
    rested that day and sent to jail. In jail it was arranged for me to
    go into treatment. My brief stint in the military qualified me for a
    veterans' program. It was there that I was introduced to Narcot-
    ics Anonymous. I am so grateful for "H&I" meetings, because 8

    that's how I was introduced to the program that would save this
    addict's life.
      The first Narcotics Anonymous meeting I went to, I knew that
    I was home. I saw addicts like me recovering. I realized that it
    was possible to live free from our addiction. I was given hope

where I had been hopeless. I was given tools where I had been
helpless. I was given a family where I had been alone. I was ex-
cited at the possibility of having another chance at life. I got a
sponsor, and he told me that he loved me, no matter what. He
has been my only sponsor for the last nineteen-plus years. And
he has continued to love me no matter what. I got custody of my
son when I was two years clean. I was able to teach him to ride
a bike, to go to Cub Scout meetings, and eventually to drive and
even to tie a tie. His mom decided to continue to use, and she
still struggles.
   Back when I had three years clean I was doing an inventory
on my mother who had adopted me. She had died during my
addiction, and I was so resentful that I didn't even go to her fu-
neral. In the course of my inventory I realized that much of my
resentment was really hurt. I find it easier to be angry than be
hurt. I wrote an amends letter and went to Chicago to read it at
her grave site.
   Before going to the cemetery I stopped at a little beach on Lake
Michigan that we called The Point. I sat there and worked on
my letter and swam in the water. For the first time in my young
recovery I began to feel serene. The critical voices in my head
seemed to quiet down, and I felt an overwhelming sense of peace
and calmness. I spent the whole day there basking in the sun-
light and my newfound serenity. Being at The Point had never
had this kind of impact on me before. As I left and was driving,
I realized that I was near my old friend's house. Something told
me to go by and see his mom. I hadn't seen her since his funeral,
where she could hardly even stand to look at me. I wanted to tell
her that I was clean and that I was sorry. I rang the doorbell, and
no one answered. So I wrote a little note on one of my business
cards. I had started a career as a substance-abuse counselor. The
note said, "Dear Mrs. C. I just wanted to let you know that I'm a
member of NarcoticsAnonymous and I'm clean over three years,
and I work helping other people get clean. I'm sorry for what

170 Narcotics Anonymous


    happened to...and I miss him very much. Love,..." I dropped
    the note in the mail slot on the door and walked back to my car.
       Before I could get to my car a gentleman opened the door and
    called me back. He was her new husband, and he didn't know
    me. He invited me in and seated me on the couch. A few mo-
    ments later my friend's mom walked in the room and was visibly
    shocked to see me. He handed her the card, and she silently read
    it. Then she started weeping, she opened her arms to me, and
    we hugged and both began to sob. She asked me if her son knew
    how much she loved him, and I assured her he always did. She
    told me she had always blamed me for his addiction but realized
    that he had always had those addict traits and it wasn't my fault.
    She said she was happy that something good came about from
    his death. We then went into the basement, and she gave me pic-
    tures and we told stories about my friend, her son. We laughed
    and cried and hugged. It was an incredible healing experience.
    As we were saying our good-byes, she told me, "Before you go,
    be sure and visit The Point, because that's where we spread his
    ashes." I cried again because I realized that I had just had what
    was the first of many spiritual awakenings in the program of
    Narcotics Anonymous.
       Today my life is a gift. I'm coming up on twenty years clean.
    I've been married for fifteen years and have another wonderful
    son. I met my German birth mother ten years ago and now have
    a family of blood relatives. My heart has been awakened, and I
    have learned how to love and be loved. I have been working in
    treatment for over eighteen years, and I've written two books for
    African Americans.
       I just returned from the NA Thirty-first World Convention in
    Hawaii where I was reminded of how this program is changing
    the world one addict at a time.
       Thanks, NA, from the bottom of my heart.

       They used together and got clean together, but this addict
    got active in the program and his brother did not. This Saudi
  Arabian member found in the loss of his brother a powerful drive
                        to carry the message.

Carrying the Message

Using    in Saudi Arabia means shame for the addict and for the
family. If anyone tells a family that their son or father is using,
the denial is often greater than that of the addict himself. My
family had to deal with not one son, but two. Eventually they
could no longer be in denial about either of us. I found help in
Narcotics Anonymous, but my brother did not.
  My family was always unstable, and eventually my parents
divorced. When my father and mother were in the middle of the
divorce I found the time, the reason, and everything I needed to
use. I started leaving school at midday to drink and smoke with
my friends. I started with prescription drugs and sometimes al-
cohol. As the years passed it became hash. I didn't complete high
school.
  In Saudi Arabia you can buy drugs in the streets, but only in
special areas. It is a Muslim country and alcohol is not allowed,
but alcohol is made illegally in certain houses. Sometimes you
can find whiskey or other things that come from outside in ex-
pensive places. In these places I found a sense of pride. I formed
a circle of mates who would meet just to use drugs together. It
very quickly went out of control as the need to belong to the
group became the most important thing. We were all too weak
to resist these peer pressures.
  At first, my brother used heroin and I used hashish, and I was
upset because he was using heroin. I went to visit friends after
Ramadan, a very important holiday in our religion. We used to
smoke hashish together, but this time I found they were using
heroin. All I said was, "Oh, you have something new here?" As

    my addiction progressed I found myself in the same marketplaces
    as my brother where they sell heroin. The dealer only said, "We
    finally see you here!"
      I tried to control my addiction by using small quantities for
    short periods. Then it totally consumed my mind. All I could
    think about was how to take it today and how to find tomor-
    row's dose. I started neglecting my work and my family. I spent
    all my money in order to take my dose, which now became my
    bread. Using became my only way to practice my daily life, even
    though I started losing myself and my health. I was asked by my
    family to leave my house. I went to stay at my father's house and
    found a new place to take drugs.
      My family demanded that I give up drugs and I promised I
    would, but to no avail. My sickness was stronger. My family en-
    circled me to force me to cut my friends off. I told them I would
    and then would lie and find excuses to take off and see them. In
    order to acquire drugs I started stealing from my siblings'wallets
    and cheating my colleagues. I hurt my loved ones but was unable
    to stop. My life deteriorated. I felt abandoned and rejected, and
    this only made me hurt more and take more.
      Eventually, I went to the hospital, mostly because of pressure
    from my family and my work. I was absent from work often, and
    they sent me to the hospital to find out what was wrong with me.
    That's when I first found out I could not stop using because my
    body was sick. Everyone had told me about the pain in the joints,
    the nausea. I realized what they meant once the drugs weren't
    available.
      I went back to using as soon as I got out. Everyone gave up
    on me, and I gave up on myself. But my prayers to God--even
    under the influence of drugs--had an effect on me. I was finally
    hospitalized again, this time by choice, when I felt that the drugs
    stopped working. In the hospital I was forced to attend a meet-
    ing brought in by NA's committee for hospitals and associations
    (the equivalent of hospitals and institutions elsewhere).

   I used to take drugs with one of the speakers. I rushed to him af-
terthelecturetoaskhowhehadmanagedtostaycleanallthattime.
His answer was through the NA program. He told me that after I
got out of the hospital he would take me to NA meetings. When it
was time to leave the hospital, he took me first to my family, then
to a meeting. I was astonished by the welcome I got at the meeting
after I had been rejected by everybody else. I was amazed by the
similarities of the sickness and suffering and by the varied lengths
of clean time of the members. During the meeting I was asking my-
self if I could really be like them. The answer was yes. I had become
like them, and I belonged to them for four months.
   AfterthefourthmonthIhadanappointmentwiththedoctorto
follow up on my condition. I consulted my sponsor beforehand,
and he told me to explain that my health had settled. The doctor
asked me if I suffered from insomnia. My sickness surfaced, and
I complained about staying up for a long time before I could fall
asleep. He prescribed medication. In only a few hours I started
replacing that medicine with other drugs. In a few months I fell
back to the same bottom--or worse--that I was in before. I asked
my sponsor for help, and he asked me to accompany him to the
hospital. I agreed, and then I finally rejoined the fellowship.
   My brother ended up in the same hospital, and we began to
stay clean together. I worked hard on myself, and my brother
worked two jobs. Most of his time was spent with work. He
didn't work in NA. I went to NA every day and was involved in
service. I asked the man who had carried the message to me in
the hospital to be my sponsor. My sponsor took me to work from
the hospital every day during that time. My brother did not have
such a person in his life. My sponsor had three years more than I
did at the time. I stayed close to him from the moment I met him
in the hospital. My brother stayed close to no one and became
consumed with his life.
   My brother didn't stay clean. I tried to help him. I tried to
speak with him, but I couldn't find the open mind. I knew that

174 Narcotics Anonymous


    when he promised to stay clean for me it wouldn't work. Our
    wives are sisters, and when they came to visit I saw that he was
    using. I sent some friends to talk to him because I thought I
    might not be the best one to help him. I would feel nervous talk-
    ing with him, and maybe if it wasn't family he would be more
    relaxed. The last time he went to the hospital, when he went to
    Umrah (our smaller pilgrimage), he looked good. I never saw
    him alive again.
      I was with my family, with everyone, when we found him
    dead from a relapse. I said, "I tried and tried to help you but I
    know the disease was stronger." I felt so sad I couldn't help him.
    This has made me more active in my recovery and has helped
    me with the members I sponsor and the members I try to carry
    the message to.
      It has been two years since I lost my brother to the disease
    of addiction. The message that I carry is that my brother and I
    used drugs together. He stopped using for seven years with me,
    but he wasn't coming to meetings regularly because he was con-
    sumed with his personal life. He was facing its hard conditions
    without attending meetings or working the steps. Even when he
    gave up on himself, the NA fellows never gave up on him. He
    ended up relapsing, and in his last relapse he gave up his last
    chance at this life. It was his last dose, and he died like others did
    before him--it is the end of our sickness.
      We know we can't force the addict to recover; we can only
    carry the message to every addict still suffering the sickness of
    addiction. I thank God that He showed us the way to the NA
    Fellowship. Today--thank God--with the help of my sponsor
    I have been clean for eleven years. I stayed clean through the
    death of my brother. I have been able to use that pain to help
    others. I have a job and family that make me proud. I no longer
    need to live in shame. Today I have found the connections with
    my family and friends in the NA program that I was looking for
    in the drugs. Today, the message that we carry in Saudi Arabia

                                                  Coming Home 175


is that addiction is not something we need to be ashamed of or
embarrassed by. The message that we carry is that any addict
can stop taking drugs, lose the desire to take them, and find a
new way to live. Today, there are addicts recovering in Saudi
Arabia--thank you, NA.

     She found NA when she was only fifteen. From her very first
       meeting, she knew NA was where she needed to be. Now,

        wasted teenager to a grateful member of the program.


Young Addict, Young NA Fellowship
Grow Up Together

Any    addict can find recovery in NA ... even a fifteen-year-old
girl from an island in South Florida who learned to drink coffee
and hang out with mostly thirty-year-olds, because she knew her
recovery depended on them--even when they hit on her, teased
her about getting clean so young, told her how lucky she was that
she didn't have to go through real pain, as she suffered silently
from her past: sexual abuse, drug overdoses, promiscuity, ar-
rests, violence, loneliness, guilt, paranoia. The thing she wanted
so badly to say was that although she was different (younger) in
their eyes, her pain was just as devastating to her as the pain of a
homeless junkie, or anyone else. She was ready to quit; she was
asking for help. There were NA members who told her she was
too young to be an addict. Others avoided or shunned her. For-
tunately, there were those who told her that she earned a seat in
Narcotics Anonymous, and to stay and fight for it.
   I remember the first time I heard the message of recovery.
Stumbling in wasted after the bell rang for my freshman high
school English class wasn't unusual. When I walked in that day,
                                         9

I realized that something was different. The class was quiet, and
some woman was talking to the teacher.
   I made my way to the back corner. Other students, trying to
avoid my frequent hostility, moved out of my way. I was just
wiping the sweat off my sunglasses when the teacher introduced
us to the lady. She said the visitor was a former drug addict and

9"Freshman" year is the first year in high school.

                                    176

was going to tell us about her drug problem. Everyone near me
started cutting up after I asked her if she'd brought us any of the
drugs she had left over.
  As she started talking about her childhood, I wadded up pa-
per in my mouth and shot it toward her with a straw. Someone
threw a crumpled-up homework assignment at her as she talked
of her arrests and drug overdoses. I laughed and encouraged
everyone to be as disrespectful and obnoxious as possible.
  The whole time we taunted her, her voice remained calm and
steady. Despite my lack of apparent interest, I heard every word
she said, every word.
  I had already wanted to, tried to, and promised to stop using
drugs, but I always failed. Incredibly, I come from a wonderful
family with loving parents and two older brothers who I admire.
My closeness to them was being destroyed, and I felt totally un-
able to do anything about it.
  Later that day, two of my clean friends, who had tried many
times to help me clean up by lying for me, carrying me into class
or home, begging me to quit, stealing my drugs, and threatening
to snitch, approached me. They asked me to skip my next class
to meet someone. When we got there, it was her--the lady who
both fascinated and terrified me.
  Before I left, she told me she would like to take me to a Narco-
tics Anonymous meeting. She said words that would later give
me comfort. She confidently said, "You never have to use again,
just for today."
  At the end of that first meeting, I found myself in the front of
the room with a plain white poker chip in my hand. I later found
out that the white poker chip was a symbol of my surrender and
a reminder that I was gambling with my life if I threw it away.
Strange as it seems, at that age, knowing nothing about NA, I felt
that I had found something that would change my life forever!
For some reason I knew that I was okay, that I had found help.
  That is how my recovery journey began, leading me to places
I never could have imagined. Over time, I would learn about the

178 Narcotics Anonymous


    traditions and the NA service structure. There at the beginning, I
    had no idea that one day I would enjoy being of service by mak-
    ing phone calls, greeting newcomers, handing out literature, set-
    ting up tables and chairs, making coffee, taking out the trash, and
    cleaning the floor of the meeting facility.
      Despite pressure from all the other teens "just doing time," I
    was blessed with the willingness to get a sponsor and build that
    relationship. I had no idea that I would be sponsoring many wom-
    en over the years because I had something worth giving, and was
    willing to give it because someone else gave it so freely to me.
      I was blessed with the gift of taking recovery seriously. I lis-
    tened and stuck with the "winners," like I was told. I trusted my
    sponsor's suggestion to attend the world convention in Chicago
    and met and shared recovery with addicts from all over the world.
    Many of them are still clean today, and I consider them my broth-
    ers and sisters. I have also seen many addicts whom I love die.
      I didn't know that one day the woman who shared her story
    in my class would relapse, overdose, and die after having three
    years clean. I didn't know that one day I would pick up a twenty-
    year medallion at the group she started, my home group to this
    day. I had no idea of my good fortune for grabbing onto NA not
    only at my young age, but also at an age when NA was young.
      I believe in the NA message to my core, not just from all the
    gifts of recovery, but from the terrible pain I've faced in recovery
    as well. There were lonely, horrible times that I didn't want to
    live through, and the times when I couldn't hold on, but God,
    the Twelve Steps, and other recovering addicts pulled me out of
    them, clean!
      The Narcotics Anonymous message that I struggle to live each
    and every day in my heart is still as relevant for me today as it
    was when I first heard from that woman who had the courage
    to share her story in my high school class: "That an addict, any
    addict, can stop using drugs, lose the desire to use, and find a
    new way to live."

                            Any addict, even you!

   At the end of his using even the other street boys and the dealers
         didn't want him around, but NA felt like home from
       his very first meeting. Sometimes he is the only person
       in the room, but that only renews this Kenyan addict's
                       commitment to recovery.

A Quiet Satisfaction

In the streets of Nairobi, Kenya, East Africa, my name kept
changing as my addiction progressed. Toward the end of my us-
ing I was just "the junkie in sunglasses."
  Born in the ghettos of Nairobi, I knew at a very early age about
the reality of drugs, crime, prostitution, rape, and death. That's
part of the package in the slums. My mum passed away when
I was ten, and my sisters were sent to a children's home. I was
lucky to be taken in by my Sunday school teacher, a missionary
from Norway.
  I attended the best high school in the region, with a reputa-
tion for great discipline. My schoolwork was good. I excelled
in sports and was captain of the school football team. I played
for the national team and was "Sportsman of the Year" at my
university. I had everything to live for. The future was looking
bright for this ghetto boy.
  I started drinking and smoking cigarettes in college. Smoking
contributed to the onset of severe asthma, and soon I was unable
to play football. To escape, I took to excessive drinking. I cursed
God for taking away my favorite sport. Eventually I would
take any drug that was offered to me. I graduated with a lower
second-class honors degree--and a habit.
  Upon graduation I got a job with a pharmaceutical company,
and my addiction skyrocketed. What a combination: an addict
with the keys to a drugstore! I was using heroin for a few weeks,
then detoxifying myself with drugs that I took from the com-
pany. Not surprisingly, my boss decided to let me go.

      My personal relationships were also falling apart. My fiancée
    was devastated when I canceled our wedding three weeks before
    the ceremony. Luckily for her, she got a transfer out of town. We
    already had a beautiful son who was caught in the middle of all
    this. I was a junkie on the loose. Heroin had me in its grip.
      The trips to doctors and psychiatrists started. My doctor said,
    "You will end up in the street and die of an overdose. Guys like
    you never make it," and with that I felt I had permission for full-
    blown drug use.
      As predicted by my good doctor, I was in the street hustling
    within a year. I scammed my friends and former workmates.
    Periodically, I moved to remote towns to clean up. Eventually,
    when I returned to Nairobi, my feet would lead me like a zom-
    bie to the using joints and I would be back at square one. I saw
    crazy, crazy stuff during this time. I once held someone's hand to
    help him find a vein, and as he passed away from an overdose I
    picked his pocket. Then I rushed to buy the same stuff. Whatever
    he was using must be really good.
      I lived among street boys and watched as they abused each
    other. I felt nothing. I had to beg, and when I became too much
    of a freeloader, even the "scum of the streets" avoided me. I was
    unwanted by the world, including my fellow users. Dealers be-
    gan to hate guys who shot up. Nobody wanted a guy to die on
    their doorstep. It was bad for business.
      Fortunately, I was not a good thief, which kept me out of jail.
    Having no money to buy drugs and not knowing how to steal
    contributed to my willingness to change. With my willpower,
    self-help books, faith in God, and geographic changes, I could
    pull myself together and stay clean for short periods, but even-
    tually the pain of not using would supersede the benefits of my
    newfound freedom from active addiction. I visited witch doc-
    tors, and I have marks on my chest to show for their efforts.
    Nothing worked.

   I had been off heroin for three months when I met a guy I had
used with. He looked all cleaned up. I wanted what he had. He
led me to my first Narcotics Anonymous meeting. My intuition
told me I had finally found the help I needed. In the meeting I
recognized some other guys I had used with. I made myself a
cup of coffee and knew I was home. I needed to see someone I
knew get clean in order to believe that recovery was possible for
me.
   Though I was in and out of the rooms several times after that
first meeting, I now knew that I had a choice. In my heart I knew
that the solution to my drug problem was in the rooms, that NA
was my hope for recovery. I have never doubted this fact.
   I am now three years clean. In these last three years I have
watched others walk in just like I did, and I have seen the chang-
es that take place as they keep coming back. Witnessing this has
been one of the greatest gifts of my recovery.
   Meetings in Kenya are small in numbers and in clean time.
The average meeting has four to fifteen members; most of them
have less than a year clean. There are language barriers for mem-
bers who can't communicate in English. Recently, public aware-
ness about NA has been increasing. Meetings are starting in
Mombasa and Malindi, our coastal towns. There are some con-
flicts in the fellowship here, which I am told is part and parcel of
growing groups. I admit that we could have done better. How-
ever, I mark the progress. I hear the laughter. I see the meetings
growing--but sometimes it's still difficult to get more than one
person in a meeting.
   Personally, I enjoy the quiet when no one shows up to the NA
meeting. It renews my commitment every time I find myself
alone in a room--although most meetings, these days, have a
minimum of four members (and sometimes even twenty).
   There are great friendships in the fellowship here. We make
cakes for birthdays and have a good rapport--you know we ad-
dicts are really down-to-earth people. There is a lot of laughter

182 Narcotics Anonymous


    after meetings. My cell phone reads like an NA phone book. We
    go bowling together, to the movies, to dinner. Recently, one of
    my new friends in NA taught me how to scuba dive, jet ski, and
    parasail. I could never imagine doing things like that and having
    fun. My friends, my true friends, are now in NA.
       Service has been the cornerstone of my recovery. My friends
    tell me that I underrate all I do, but I feel apprehensive sharing
    about service. I try to serve with humility--nothing compares to
    the joy of service, of sharing the NAway, setting up tables, attend-
    ing meetings, connecting members with each other, passing on
    books and other NA literature, corresponding with those visiting
    Kenya, holding public information workshops, bringing together
    new groups outside Nairobi, and now, recently, sponsoring other
    members. Surrounding countries like Rwanda, Uganda, and Tan-
    zania are starting to ask for literature. We are working on getting
    them what they need. What a quiet satisfaction there is in being
    useful. It makes me feel even better when I don't mention it. Please
    do not take this as being proud of what I do.
       My recovery has been based on three fundamental truths that
    work for me: One, do not pick up no matter what--all feelings
    eventually pass; two, go to meetings; and three, pray. I tell my
    sponsees these same things. My experience is that everything
    else sorts itself out with this as a base. I have a lot more to learn
    about the NA way.
       Recently, I've learned that I have hepatitis C and have been
    getting answers from members in the fellowship who live miles
    away about how to deal with it. With this new challenge, my
    friends in the fellowship (and even their families) have been
    asking me what they can do to help me. I tell them that they are
    doing enough just being willing to support me. I am also back
    to school in a postgraduate program. I've been talking to the son
    I almost lost during my addiction. He recently told me he loves
    me. He is twelve years old and has never said anything like that
    before. I can't express how much this means to me--especially
    after all the damage I caused.

  Through my recovery I am reestablishing relationships and
making new ones. I am also discovering myself and slowly find-
ing out what I can do and be. It far exceeds what I ever imagined
before finding NA.
  Our fellowship here is still young. Visiting NA members have
given us so much. I have found people I identify with, tools
to live by, and a purpose that has filled the void that existed
throughout my life. You are welcome to visit us here in Nairobi,
Kenya, any time. God bless Narcotics Anonymous.

   When he got to NA he was also in a drug-replacement program.
   He wanted what he saw in the rooms of Narcotics Anonymous,
    but was afraid of returning to his old life if he quit methadone.
           For ten months he went to meetings every day--
                       and finally he got clean.


The Only Requirement

Our   Third Tradition states that "the only requirement for mem-
bership is a desire to stop using." I don't know if I had a desire to
stop using when I came to my first NA meeting, but I sure had a
desire to stop hurting. I was very, very tired. Tired enough to be
curious about NA. Tired enough to listen.
   At my first NA meeting, something very powerful happened
to me: I met addicts who were recovering. I knew lots of addicts,
of course. I had been on the streets for years at that point, and ev-
ery person in my life was an addict. But all of my addict friends
were still using. I had never met a clean addict before. This was
something very new and attractive to me. These people shared
their stories, and I identified instantly. Clearly they were people
like me. The only difference was that there was something else
going on their lives besides the daily struggle to score and stay
out of jail. They shared about living in recovery. There was a
light on behind their eyes, and their lives seemed to be full of
hope and possibility.
   At that first meeting, I was the last person in the circle to share.
I identified as an addict but stated truthfully that I had a lot of
reservations about never using again. I told the group that I was
taking a break from the street and had stopped shooting dope,
but that I was on methadone maintenance and also still using
other substances. To my surprise, no one judged me. They wel-
comed me to the fellowship of NA and told me to keep coming
back. "You are right where you belong," they said. They gave

me telephone numbers, a meeting list, and something even more
powerful: their acceptance.
   I don't know why I decided to be honest at that first meeting.
Years on the street had made lying and deception my natural
response to every new situation. But for some reason, I realized
that there was no point lying to these people. The only person I
would be hurting was me. I thank my higher power that I was
guided to speak simply and honestly about where I actually was,
rather than to put on a front. That decision probably saved my
life. Because I told the truth, people in NA were able to tell me
the things I needed to hear. What really impressed me was that
no one told me what to do. Instead, they shared their own expe-
riences. It was up to me to decide how to use this new informa-
tion in my own life. Over time, I began to accept that the tools
that were working for others could work for me too.
   One of the biggest challenges I faced as a new member in re-
covery was the fact that I came into the fellowship on methadone
maintenance. I had a lot of reservations about getting clean and
was particularly scared about getting off methadone. Being in a
drug-replacement program had helped me get some structure
into my life after years of living on the street. I now had a roof
over my head and was working again. I was afraid that if I gave
up methadone I would return to the insanity of homelessness
and life as a criminal. As always, the wisdom and experience
of other NA members helped guide me through this dilemma.
Nobody told me what to do. Instead, by quiet example, they
showed me the possibilities of a life free from active addiction.
Over time I came to believe that being employed and off the
street was not enough. Until I stopped using, whether the drugs
were legal or illegal, I was not going to experience the full ben-
efits of recovery.
   I made the decision to begin the process of detoxing from
methadone maintenance. Getting clean was very hard for me,
both physically and emotionally. I came to NA meetings on a

186 Narcotics Anonymous


    daily basis for ten months before I experienced my first day
    clean. There were no role models for me: I was the only person
    at my methadone clinic who was voluntarily detoxing. Every
    day I would have to run a gauntlet of drug dealers peddling
    pills as I walked to and from the clinic. Another challenge that I
    had to face was within the rooms of NA. I had learned from my
    very first meeting that it was important that I share openly and
    honestly. When I shared, I told the truth: I was not yet clean, but
    I was working really hard to get there. To my surprise, some
    people were really upset when I shared in NA meetings. One
    person came up to me after a meeting and told me that I had no
    right to share until I was clean. I was really confused and hurt
    the first time this happened. It was the first time I had not felt
    welcome in NA. Fortunately, an older member overheard the ex-
    change and took me aside. She told me that the only requirement
    for NA membership was the desire to stop using. She reassured
    me, "You just keep coming back, honey; you're right where you
    belong." I thank my higher power that I listened to her message
    of love and acceptance. I did keep coming back. Every time I
    talked about my struggle and my doubts, members would share
    something from their own experiences that was helpful to me.
       The wisdom and experience of other NA members was criti-
    cal to the process of my getting clean. They even helped me get
    health insurance and get into the hospital so that I could com-
    plete the final stage of my detox under medical supervision.
    Thanks to NA, when I walked out of that hospital--clean for the
    first time in my adult life--I had a sponsor, a home group, and a
    service position waiting for me. Most importantly, I had admit-
    ted that I was powerless over addiction and had come to believe
    that only a power greater than myself could restore me to san-
    ity. I didn't realize it at the time, but by choosing to keep coming
    back, by listening, by learning, and by following the example of
    other NA members, I had made a decision to turn my will and
    my life over to a power greater than myself. By the grace of that
    power, I am still clean today, twenty-one years later.

   She walked into NA--literally--and was treated with more love
     and respect than she ever had been. For this Mexican woman,
               a chance encounter on the beach opened
                     the door to hope and freedom.


Restored to Dignity

Obsession     and compulsion were present in my life way before
I started using drugs. From the time I was very young I had
a problem with the way I used things: how I ate, watched TV,
slept, bit my fingernails, and demanded attention from others.
   My family's history is marked by war, armed conflicts, and
migrations. My grandparents left Poland and went to Chile,
running away from World War II. I was born in Chile the same
year there was a coup, and my mother sought political asylum
in Mexico, where I was raised. I always felt different; I was never
able to determine exactly where I was from or where I belonged,
and I had difficulty relating to other people. I didn't have any
concept of God, because I come from a leftist family that is
deeply atheist. I lived in isolation.
   I was desperate to belong, to be accepted, and to have friends.
When I was ten years old I went to a party where there were
drugs and I got high for the first time. I passed out and a couple
of men put me in a sleeping bag and almost kicked me to death.
They were also using and thought it was fun to hurt another
person. I accepted that I was going to suffer whatever was neces-
sary in order to hang out with people who used drugs. I felt that
I had found the key to enter other people's worlds. Sometimes I
wonder how I ever thought I could control my using. From the
first time, it was a disaster.
   I cannot say at which moment drugs became the most impor-
tant thing in my life. But the degradation progressed rapidly. I
didn't obey any rules. I constantly ran away from home, and I
learned to exchange sex for drugs, shelter, food, and protection.

    Honestly, I didn't feel anything for anybody. But drugs...made
    me feel something. Nothing else mattered. I was still shy and
    afraid, but as long as I could get loaded, I could lock myself up
    in my own world where nothing could touch me. I didn't know
    that there was a God, but I knew that hell existed, and I was liv-
    ing it. I harmed a lot of people, especially those who loved me
    the most.
       I graduated from school only through the blessings of my
    Higher Power.
       After graduation I went to work and found that having money
    meant having drugs, and that meant having power. I believed I
    had my life under control. If I had drugs, I could buy other peo-
    ple and make them do what I wanted. But there weren't enough
    drugs or money to fill the huge gap that I had inside of me.
       I couldn't relate to anybody who was not using. I had boy-
    friends who didn't use drugs. They were good, loving men who
    wanted to be with me. But I saw them as inferior, dumb, and
    boring because they didn't use. All those relationships ended
    quickly.
       Pretty soon I returned to the same place: selling my body,
    cheating, and stealing to continue using. I was arrested. I had
    street fights and physical confrontations with my family. I would
    wake up in the street with barely any clothes on because I had
    pawned or lost them. It didn't matter who I used with; anyone
    who had drugs could go to bed with me. After every moment of
    crisis I would convince myself that it wasn't so bad and I could
    try it once more.
       When I didn't have drugs, I destroyed everything around me. I
    cut myself or I hit my head against the walls and doors. I also hit
    other people. I ended up alone because nobody could stand to be
    around me. There were holes in the doors of my apartment from
    all the times that I hit my head in desperation.
       My life was horrible. I had lost any kind of hope that I could
    change. I didn't have any idea that Narcotics Anonymous

                                                      Coming Home 189


existed. I believed that I had to keep using. I didn't imagine that
there were alternatives; neither my family nor I could afford to
pay for a treatment program.
   I was introduced to Narcotics Anonymous in a very strange
manner, which kept me from being able to close my eyes to my
own life. I found NA on a beach on New Year's Eve. There was
a group of addicts celebrating their recovery around a bonfire
while I was going crazy looking for drugs. I literally bumped
into them! I was so high that I couldn't talk. I had no idea who
these people were, but they seemed so happy that I thought they
probably had some good drugs. I was excited when they invited
me to sit with them. I thought they were going to give me some-
thing really powerful and that I was going to get higher.
   Instead of giving me drugs, they treated me better than any-
one had before. They didn't ask anything from me; they just
stayed with me, and that made a difference. They waited a few
hours until I was able to speak, and then they told me: If you
want to, you can stay clean, just for today.
   I can't explain what happened in that moment, but I spent my
first day clean with NA members on that beach. I thought they
were funny, and there were a couple of good-looking boys, but
deep inside I didn't believe them. I couldn't believe that I would
be able to stay clean. However, that day passed and I didn't use.
When I went back to the city I had five days of clean time--five
days that I spent with members of Narcotics Anonymous I had
never met before. As soon as I got to my house I knew that I
would not be able to stay clean alone. I ran to a meeting.
   When I got to my first meeting, I was dirty, alone, and afraid.
But I felt the care and concern of the members I had met, and I
wanted more. Those days I had spent at the beach were sensa-
tional: No one had hit me or humiliated me. I had not done any-
thing wrong. I was tired of my life and myself, and I didn't have
anything to lose, so I opened the door.

190 Narcotics Anonymous


       I began to attend meetings every day, and I stayed clean. I didn't
    know exactly why I was in the rooms of NA or why I continued
    to come back. But I wanted what those people had, the sparkle in
    their eyes, the smiles, that indescribable light that recovering ad-
    dicts have, which has helped me to recover.
       What happened to me is truly a miracle. I am still clean, ever
    since that first encounter with NA at the beach. Years have gone
    by, and now I live with dignity. My first months clean were beau-
    tiful, because I was being taken care of. I hope that all addicts
    who are seeking recovery have the opportunity to receive as
    much love and attention as I did when I first came to meetings,
    because I got just what I needed and much more.
       I followed suggestions when I got to NA. I attended ninety
    meetings in ninety days. I found a sponsor, and I began to work
    the program. It wasn't as difficult as I first thought. After a while
    I felt so good that I thought I didn't need as much help and that I
    could attend meetings less frequently. It's not a new story; other
    NAmembers have shared similar experiences. My recovery pro-
    cess has been more painful because many times I have lost the
    willingness to change and my defects of character have ruled my
    life. I hold onto resentments, especially when I feel I have a right
    to be angry. But resentments harm me more than anybody else
    and they don't allow me to move forward, so I continue trying
    to forgive. I also need to learn how to receive guidance, because
    I still don't always react appropriately when someone offers me
    a suggestion. I have never liked to be told what to do.
       But the feeling I get when I'm with members of NA, when I go
    to meetings, or when I attend a convention, is such that I eventu-
    ally do the right thing. Today staying clean is the most important
    thing I can do. To accomplish that, I need the Twelve Steps, a
    sponsor, a Higher Power, and service. I have lived through many
    bad experiences being clean, because I am stubborn. I tend to
    prioritize other things like my work, my mate, and fun. When I
    do this my life becomes a disaster. I am not a quick learner, but

I am beginning to understand that as long as I take care of my
recovery, everything else will get better.
   Today, Narcotics Anonymous makes more sense to me than
anything else. Giving to others fills me up more than drugs, sex,
food, or money ever did. I have a Higher Power now and that
makes me feel more tranquil. I trust that no matter what happens
I won't be alone. Today all things are better balanced.
   I am very dramatic. When I don't get what I want, I suffer too
much. I must learn to allow things to happen, always doing the
best I can. But the emptiness I feel today is not as deep as it was
in the past. I am not very stable emotionally, and I have occa-
sional obsessive thoughts. I still have a lot of work ahead of me.
But nothing compares to the nightmare of using. I know that I
don't have to make a storm in a glass of water.      10

   There's a lot to be done for the fellowship in my country. There
are more meetings now than when I met the program, but many
people still don't know that Narcotics Anonymous exists here. I
didn't know. Today it is my commitment to let everyone know
that we exist, because I don't want addicts like me to believe that
it is not possible to recover.
   Life on life's terms has ups and downs. People I loved have
passed away. I went through a divorce, and I lost a job. But I no
longer hurt myself the way I did when I was using. I don't cut
myself, and I don't bang my head. You have taught me that to-
day there is no reason to use again.
   I want to be here and be part of all this. To feel that I belong
to this fellowship has been fundamental to staying clean. I once
thought that if I survived to my thirtieth birthday I would kill
myself. All my idols were musicians and artists who died young
from overdoses. Today I am thirty-two years old and I love to be
alive. The best experience of my life has been to see how the eyes
of an addict who begins to recover don't have that look of death
anymore. Seeing that awakening is worth more than anything
else. Forever and ever, thanks for opening the door of life to me.

   A host of bad choices ultimately led to relapse for this addict with
   thirteen years clean. It was a hard road back to recovery, but NA
                 loved her until she could love herself.

Second Chance

As   I sat on the edge of the couch with my head in my hands,
I felt completely bewildered. I was crying, but I didn't feel any
tears, I was screaming, but there wasn't any sound, and I was
watching my husband of twelve years pace the house like a
caged animal. I was too nervous to talk to him, and afraid not to.
Our NAfriends from around the country were ringing the phone
off the hook. They all had suggestions and ideas. There was a
lot of whispering going on; plans were being made. My whole
life was in complete and utter insanity. This all seemed so sur-
real; a few weeks earlier at my NA home group I had picked up
my thirteen-year medallion, and less than a month later, there I
was, sitting on my couch...a newcomer. Today I know that my
relapse started long before that.
   Over the years I have heard many addicts say, "One bad
thought and one bad action could lead to relapse." For me, at
the time, it wasn't about the thought because I didn't think; I
hadn't any thought at all. For me, it was entirely about my bad
actions. I was in my office, sitting at my business partner's desk,
and inside a slightly opened drawer I saw a pile of crystal meth.
I reached in, took it out and played with it a little bit, and snorted
it. Period. I certainly wish I had thought something, anything;
but I didn't. I had stopped thinking well before I was faced with
the opportunity to do that "one bad action."
   Today, I know so many factors played into my relapse. I hardly
went to meetings, almost none at all. I hadn't been keeping in
contact with fellow addicts, and I had held onto a self-centered
resentment with my sponsor that separated us for a whole year.

The list could go on and on: dishonesty, complacency, greed, ar-
rogance, judgment.
   For a long time I had felt immune to relapse and had an at-
titude of "better than." When I got clean the first time, I consid-
ered myself a "high bottom" addict. Sure, I used a lot of different
drugs, just about anything I could get my hands on, but cocaine
and pot were my drugs of choice. I was a middle-class girl who
turned up her nose at "dirty" drugs like meth or crank. The
progression of my disease, for all those years clean, is hard to
believe. When I relapsed, I used like there wasn't any tomorrow,
like there wasn't any price to be paid. I recklessly tore through
the lives of those who loved me. The greater the pain, the more
I used, without any thought of living or dying. Overnight, my
addiction once again held me prisoner. I started gouging at the
skin on my face and pulling chunks of flesh from my body from
that very first day! I continued to believe that I was infested with
bugs for a very long time. I was hooked, and even though I kept
using, the drugs weren't getting me high any longer. I just kept
getting more and more detached mentally, physically, emotion-
ally, and spiritually. I knew that I had unleashed a huge monster.
I remember feeling so trapped--by the thoughts in my head full
of Narcotics Anonymous and by my body full of drugs.
   When I heard my sponsor's voice on the telephone, the resent-
ment that had separated us for so long disappeared. I was really
comforted by the sound of her voice. Her words took me to a safe
and vulnerable place that I hadn't been to in quite some time. But
they also confirmed for me that I had gotten myself into a real
nightmare, a nightmare that neither she nor anyone else could
fix for me. Surrender was a long way away.
   The very last place that I wanted to go to was treatment be-
cause of all my judgment about treatment in the past, but I knew
once my sponsor and other NAfriends started suggesting it, that
was exactly where I was headed. In a moment of clarity I admit-
ted that I didn't want to become a statistic of "jails, institutions,

194 Narcotics Anonymous


    or death." I knew that I was in serious trouble. Instead of feeling
    grateful that I was being given the chance to get clean again, I
    felt angry, hurt, scared, and crazy with paranoia. I had lived the
    miracle of the program for thirteen years, and now I felt like an
    alien. It felt like I didn't fit anywhere, not in NAand certainly not
    on the streets. I didn't stay clean. I was mentally unstable and a
    danger to myself as well as to others. I kept fighting the process
    like a soldier at war. I left the inpatient treatment facility against
    the advice of my counselor. I was so raw and completely full of
    rage. Unfortunately for me, it took three trips to treatment to fi-
    nally "get it."
      Getting off drugs was not easy, but it was the easier part. My
    pain, shame, guilt, and complete confusion were all too much to
    take. Instead of calling my sponsor or support system, I ran...
    from everyone and everything. I went from town to town. I land-
    ed back in my hometown and checked into yet another treat-
    ment center. I finally realized I was the problem. I went to their
    outpatient program for only three days, but I did continue to see
    their addiction specialist for over a year. He drug-tested me on
    a regular basis and was very NA-oriented. I needed that kind of
    accountability. I was so unpredictable. I didn't trust anything,
    most of all myself.
      Alot of my relapse is a blur to me. I haven't any memory of the
    very last time I used before entering treatment, but I will never,
    ever forget walking back through the doors of NA. I was terri-
    fied. I sat through that first meeting wanting to get loaded and
    run. I was sweating. I was shaking, and my stomach felt like I
    was going to be sick. I didn't think that I had what it took to do
    this whole recovery thing again. I truly believed that I was just a
    "has-been." My sponsor suggested that I share at the next meet-
    ing that I attended. The only thing that I said was my name, and
    that I had relapsed with thirteen years clean. I have never expe-
    rienced anything like that night. I expected judgment and criti-
    cism, but what I actually received was nothing but love. I was

                                                      Coming Home 195


embraced by the addicts in that room. I arrived at the meeting
feeling hopeless and left feeling like I too had a fighting chance.
   I had to do everything differently. For a long time I felt as if I
would never be "normal" again, and regardless of stubbing my
toes along the way, I just kept trying. As much as I would love to
say that I was grateful at that moment for being clean and that
nothing else mattered, I can't. I was stuck in the place of "how
I used to be, or how I used to look" for a long time. The major-
ity of my "clean life" before relapsing was a beautiful thing. I
had some good friends, great family, and a dedicated marriage.
Once I picked up, everything, every aspect of my life, changed.
My friends and family were scared to death that I would end up
dead, and my marriage hit the skids, to say the least. I was so
overwhelmed by feelings; I thought I would just die.
   Numbing those feelings felt like an option for a long, long
time. It wasn't until I began writing on my steps again, getting
honest with my sponsor, and sharing in meetings that my think-
ing began to change. The more meetings I attended, the better
I felt. I had to realize that what I had put myself through was a
trauma to my body and mind. I had to quit fighting the griev-
ing process that was necessary for me to begin to heal, trust, and
change. It was necessary for me to grieve the woman I once was,
the life I once had, and the marriage that my husband and I had
worked so hard to build in order to accept the woman I was be-
coming, and make a new life for myself. I learned to be gentle
with myself, as I would with any newcomer.
   The knowledge that I had accumulated the first thirteen years
had to be put aside so I could become teachable. I had to learn
the gift of humility and vulnerability. I learned to be honest with
myself as well as with others, no matter the shame I felt. I learned
how to ask for help and accept it when it was offered. The days of
thinking that meetings were a social affair or fashion show were
over. For me, meetings were essential to staying clean; this was
the real deal. I was here this time to save my life.

       Today, looking back, it feels as if that period of my life was
    forever ago. I can remember being on my knees, praying to my
    Higher Power for the obsession to use be lifted, and begging for a
    quiet heart and peace of mind. The desperation I felt during that
    time just makes me shudder. Other than being clean, I just want-
    ed to feel comfortable in my own skin, and not be overtaken with
    nightmarish thoughts and using dreams. Today I am worlds
    away from that woman who entered treatment over seven years
    ago. I am comfortable in my own skin, and best of all, I do have
    a quiet heart and peace of mind. I am extremely grateful to my
    Higher Power, my sponsor, and all the people who helped guide
    me back to the quality of life that I am once again living. I have
    a deep compassion for the still-suffering addict, be it the addict
    who is sitting in the rooms of Narcotics Anonymous, the addict
    who has yet to find the rooms, or especially the addict who left
    and has yet to find the way back again.
       I can only pray that I will never let fade the memory of the pain
    it took for me to return to the program, and always remember I
    was loved back, not judged back. I want to always remember so
    that I can extend that same respect to another addict. I have so
    much today, but honestly, none of it was possible without a lot of
    hard footwork. I had to begin by forgiving myself for disrespect-
    ing the very program that saved my life the first time twenty-one
    years ago, for disrespecting my marriage which began in recov-
    ery, and last but not least, for disrespecting myself for returning
    to a life of drugs and disease.
       I don't live in shame today about what happened, but I have
    learned from my mistakes. I share honestly and openly with
    other addicts. I would give anything and everything under the
    sun to have taken a different route, but because I can't I need to
    accept the responsibility for my own actions and grow from it. I
    believe today that if I had never relapsed I would have twenty-
    one years abstinent and that is all; but thankfully, I have seven
    and a half years clean with tons of heart and soul, dedication,

                                                     Coming Home 197


and a love that I can hardly put into words. With the help of
others, the Twelve Steps, and the principles of this program, my
marriage was saved. I have gained trust within my family and
friends again. I am no longer an outsider looking in; I am a part
of. It has been a long road back, but I believe I am one of the
lucky ones.

     NA helped this Israeli addict rediscover his love of life. He had
      always felt like an outsider before he got clean. Now he has
         a home group and understands fellowshipping to be
                          a spiritual principle.

Sowing the Seed

In  Israel, we sing at meetings. If it's your turn to get a keytag,
we sing a song that has became an NA anthem in Israel. It's a
song about a simple guy who doesn't want much. And this guy
has made a mistake here and there, but he can see the future
and it looks good as long as we all stick together. We sing at
every meeting. We go to the European conventions and everyone
knows that the Israelis are the noisiest fellowship. We never stop
singing.
   We also have a "count-up" at every meeting. We start by ask-
ing if there's anyone attending the meeting for the first time--
then it goes to two weeks, then to one month, then up to three
months and then six months...it can go on and on up to twenty
years. We hug all the newcomers who are courageous enough to
say, "I have three days today." We hug you if you have two days
clean or two years clean.
   We recruit newcomers to do small group tasks. A group may
have twelve officers: One newcomer makes the coffee, one
brings the cups, the other opens the room, and the other closes
it. In my first three months clean, I was the key-holder. I didn't
actually open the meeting, but I held the key until the trusted
servant who opened the meeting came.
   This was so important to me because it showed that I be-
longed. From my early childhood, I had felt like an outsider.
In elementary school I was never invited to parties and had no
friends. I became a real troublemaker. If I couldn't get love at
least I could get attention. At home, I felt as if I was standing in
my parents' way. My parents were busy with their careers and


                                   198

                                                      Coming Home 199


did the best they could. I grew up with caregivers who took
care of me during the day, and I joined my parents when they
returned from work.
   In high school I became a DJ and played music in the school-
yard. But that attention wasn't enough. I still wasn't content, and
after a year of high school I dropped out. I spent all of my free
time at the beach using. I was fifteen years old. I had two years
until mandatory military service. My parents gave up hope, and
I spent more time in the streets than at home.
   On my first day in the army I found what I was looking for,
drug partners. I had thought that military service would mod-
erate my drug use, but it turned out I used more and different
drugs. It didn't take long to realize I wanted out of the military. I
went to an army shrink and told him I was having nightmares. I
was so high, I could only mumble, and I was sent to a psychiatric
hospital for observation. It was an open hospital, so I received no
medications. I was there during the day, and in the afternoons
I left to hang out with my friends to get high. Two months later
they discharged me. I was free.
   I took the first flight to Amsterdam. A friend picked me up
from the airport, and on the way to his house, he offered me
heroin. I told him I don't do heroin, I only do cocaine. Ironically,
a year later, heroin was my favorite drug. I was homeless, no job,
no food, but as soon as I put my hands on money, I spent it all
on drugs. At night I went to the marketplace and took leftover
food from the garbage. I slept in empty apartments with no heat
or water, but I was sure that I was on the top of the world. Six
months later I was back in Tel Aviv selling drugs. I thought that
I was an important man. I justified my actions by telling myself
that I needed to sell drugs to keep my habit. In recovery, I re-
alized that one of the reasons I sold drugs was to keep people
around me.
   Eventually, I was beaten, lonely, and alienated. I felt like a
failure, and worst of all, I wasn't ready to stop using. One day

    a using friend suggested we go to an NA meeting. He told me
    that NAwas a group of addicts who meet together and help each
    other. At that time there were only seven NA meetings a week
    in Israel and they were all in Tel Aviv. The only reason I went to
    that first NA meeting with my friend was because I knew that
    we were going to go out afterwards and buy more drugs. There
    were forty or fifty people at the meeting, some of whom I knew.
    This was the first time in my life I saw junkies who had stopped
    using. I didn't believe that this was possible. I went to another
    meeting a few days later and I saw people laughing and enjoying
    themselves, but I was not ready to give up. Today I know that a
    seed was planted inside me at those first meetings. I started to
    believe that there was another way.
       People used to tell me, "You've got so much potential." I didn't
    want to hear about going to school, having a steady job, or build-
    ing a family. I never completed anything. I love NA because it is
    spiritual, abstract, and endless. We don't measure recovery by
    our accomplishments. We do the best we can each day.
       It took me another ten years of pain and suffering before I
    was ready to surrender. I lost all my friends and stopped com-
    municating with my family. I isolated myself to the point of not
    even answering the phone. I stopped functioning as a dealer. I
    stopped eating and let my personal hygiene go. I slipped into a
    long period of deep depression. The only thing I did was stay
    home alone and use drugs. There I was, a guy who loved life,
    loved to party, loved company, suddenly thinking about ending
    it all. I felt like there was no hope, and that was the biggest shock
    for me.
       I went to an NA meeting. It was summer, the room was hot,
    but I was shivering and wearing a heavy leather coat. There were
    only two other people there, and they were arguing about how
    to set up the meeting. It almost came to blows. I knew from my
    previous experience that NA was much more than this incident.
    Deep inside me I knew that NA could save my life. Soon people

                                                      Coming Home 201


came, and even though I didn't know anybody, I felt like I was
among friends. Someone reached out to me, and I joined him in
another meeting that night. Those first meetings were very sig-
nificant. I kept coming back and stayed clean. At some point I
understood that if I wanted to stay clean this time I had to make a
decision to keep an open mind and get involved. I really wanted
to be part of the fellowship. Today I know that fellowshipping is
a spiritual principle.
  During my first years in recovery, I used to go to a meeting in
an Arab neighborhood not far from my house. At this meeting,
Arab and Israeli members spoke Hebrew and shared about re-
covery from addiction. When it comes to NA, there are no poli-
tics involved. We sit in meetings together; we serve together; we
celebrate our recovery together.
  I chose a home group and committed myself to that group. I
took a service commitment. I opened the meeting space, cleaned
the floors there, and got it ready for the meeting. Today, I am still
a part of that same home group. It is a place where people can
find me, and I know that I can find my friends there too. I have a
sponsor, and I work the steps. But most importantly, I keep com-
ing back no matter what.
  Until I got clean, the only job I had was dealing drugs. I worked
a few hours a couple of days a week and made a lot of money.
In recovery, the first job I had was delivering newspapers on my
scooter. I was making less in one month than I made in one day
dealing drugs. But I delivered the papers and used the time for
meditation in motion. Today I work with homeless addicts, and
I went back to school to learn how to be better at my job. It is a
miracle that this addict has a job helping others.
  Service taught me to care about other people and respect oth-
ers. I learned to respect my family, and they see the changes I
have made through the program. Six years ago, I lost my father.
He was ill for a long time, and before he slipped into a coma, I
was able to make my amends with him. He told me that I looked

202 Narcotics Anonymous


    good and asked if I was still going to "those meetings." He for-
    gave me. I wanted him to get well, but prayed for acceptance of
    God's will. When he died, the pain was so strong I could not stop
    crying, and seeing my mother hurting as well was devastating.
    I did not know how I was going to get through this. I called a
    few NA friends, and within half an hour I was surrounded with
    love and support. This was my first experience of handling such
    severe emotions clean. I was sure I was going to break down,
    but through prayer and the support I got from my NA friends,
    the opposite happened. I found the strength and courage to go
    through the mourning process without using. Not only that,
    but I found that I was able to be there for my mother while she
    grieved. This was a humbling experience.
       When I first got clean, I thought that I was giving up so much:
    my friends, my status, my good times. I even gave up listening
    to music at first. Now I know that I've received much more in
    return. I have lots of new friends who are recovering addicts,
    and I am a respected member of society. I am well appreciated at
    work, and music is still my passion. Once, when I got fired from
    a job, I was devastated. I was confused about my higher power's
    intentions for me. I confronted my sponsor with my lack of faith,
    and he told me to pray and check God's will for me. The pain and
    the blow to my ego were too big; the fear of how I would pay
    the rent was overwhelming. My sponsor told me that God has a
    better plan for me. Later, after some time had passed, I realized
    how right he was. When I am in pain, I remember that pain is
    my best teacher. When I have attacks of self-pity, I visualize my
    higher power looking at me and asking his secretary, "Get me his
    file." He looks at the file, smiles, and says to his secretary, "This
    guy doesn't realize all the good things that he is going to get." I
    am full of hope. I am grateful for everything I have been given.
    I love you, NA.

       A simple act of kindness showed this Dutch addict that he
   belonged in Narcotics Anonymous. He worked through his fears
    that a relationship with God would be barred to him because he
              is gay and learned to trust the power of love.

Sandwich

Iremember      the upstairs hallway where I was sitting. I looked at
the woodwork of the stairs and thought it would hold a rope.
   I also knew that I would not do anything to die, even though
I did not want to go on.
   I looked in the phone book for a helpline. I called in and talked
to a man. He said I could meet him for coffee and that I did not
have to say anything, but if I wanted to I could.
   I went to see him and tried to keep my sadness inside. I drank
a cup of coffee and was glad I wasn't at home where the walls
were closing in on me. The man told me about the meetings he
went to, and asked if I wanted to join him. I wanted to; I did not
want to be alone.
   Before the meeting we went to his house. He understood, or
maybe I told him, that I had not eaten in a few days. He made me
a sandwich. That impressed me. I had done things against my
conscience. I had lied, I had manipulated, and worse, I had used
violence. I wasn't worth it, and still that man was there for me.
   He took me to my first meeting. I don't remember what was
said, even though several people spoke to me. I know I cried. I
remember the warmth I felt when I was with those people. I felt
I shared something with them. I felt I belonged, that I belonged
to them. I had never felt anything like that.
   I had always felt different with everybody, even my family.
We lived in a village, but we weren't born there and the people
spoke a strange dialect. I went to a different school than the kids
from my block. I did not have real friends, and my older brother
died when I was in elementary school. My parents were always


                                  203

204 Narcotics Anonymous


    fighting, and I was ashamed. I often fled the house with my
    mother. After a few hours, my father would find us and bring us
    back. When I was young, I learned that for adults, yelling, fight-
    ing, using, and running away were normal ways to deal with
    problems. I was a smart and sensitive boy with an unsafe start
    in life.
      That feeling of belonging I had at that first meeting was there-
    fore so important--it made certain that I kept coming back.
      It was hard to stay clean those first weeks. Each day seemed
    to go on endlessly until the next meeting. When I stopped us-
    ing, it was as if I had been in a deep, dark cave for years and
    suddenly I stood in full sunlight. My eyes had to adjust to light
    that sometimes hurt terribly. Everything, good and bad, became
    more intense. Living without anesthesia, I did not understand
    the feelings that would suddenly surface. Sometimes I thought
    I was going crazy. I could be immensely sad without reason,
    sometimes for days. Other addicts who remembered their own
    struggle assured me that everything would be fine. I did not
    have to understand everything immediately. There would al-
    ways be someone to fall back on. I was safe. I kept coming back,
    and it got easier. The obsession disappeared.
      When I was first going to meetings, I thought my problem
    was a recent development. I had been having a toxic relation-
    ship with a man I thought I loved. I completely effaced myself,
    and thought that was love. The fights, when we used, could spin
    out of control so badly that we would go at each other with full
    wine bottles.
      But as I opened my eyes to my own reality, I started to see that
    my problem dated much further back. I remembered when the
    alcohol came out of my pores the week of my mother's funeral,
    even though I was only twenty. I remembered that I had had
    fights in bars before; that relationships had ended before; that
    I had wanted to die before and had made pathetic attempts to
    do so. I had been in situations before where people wanted to

                                                       Coming Home 205


kill me. This wasn't the first time I had been through any of this.
But I had always tried to find my salvation in drugs, obsessive
sex, relationships, smoking, etc. I had been fleeing into addictive
behavior for a long, long time. NA provided me with a safe en-
vironment in which I could say anything and share everything.
This security enabled me to look beyond the last couple of years
to see patterns that had been there for decades.
   When things got out of hand, I had always thought that it was
the result of some outside force. I was intelligent; I still had my
house and job; it could not be that bad. If only people would see
me for what I was worth. If only I lived or worked somewhere
else. If only the weather were nicer. If only there had been no mili-
tary service. If only my brother had lived, or my mother. If...if...
if only I was not addicted. I had my reasons. I was a victim.
   I learned to recognize feelings. The safe environment of NA
gave me the chance to face my own fear. My fear was deep, and
deeply hidden--fear that I wouldn't amount to anything, fear of
being deserted, fear of emptiness.... I couldn't fight this fear by
myself. I couldn't even name it. Old feelings of emptiness and
loneliness can still take hold of me. But NA's Twelve Steps and
the people in the program, who I love so much, have shown me
another way. The security and solidarity that I get from the pro-
gram gave me room to breathe. It gave me freedom of choice. I
don't have to respond to situations the way I did before.
   At first, I did not like the word God. It made me think of people
and institutions that judge others, like churches that would ban
me because I am gay. It frightened me. I was afraid I would not fit
into a twelve-step program. I shared this at meetings. I talked to
other addicts and learned that spirituality is something personal.
What matters is my understanding of God, not anyone else's.
   With their help, I learned to trust a power of love that is much
bigger than me.
   When I told my father I was an addict, he told me that his fa-
ther had died from addiction. My grandfather was apparently

206 Narcotics Anonymous


    not the bohemian from the family stories. He was an addict. As a
    young boy my father had to go to the pub to beg him for money
    for the household. That man died from alcohol after he left his
    wife and kids in poverty. Out of shame, my father had never told
    that to anyone. Learning his secret gave me more compassion for
    my father--and more compassion for myself. I have a disease
    that has occurred in my family several times. I did not choose
    to be addicted. I am unable to take the disease away. And other
    people, whether or not they are addicts, have their stories. Begin-
    ning to see how powerless I am and getting more understanding
    for the powerlessness of others allowed me to breathe again, and
    has given me the space to find more good in myself and others.
       When my father died, I was able to be there for his widow and
    others, as a mature man who could be a support. I don't have to
    approve of what I have done, or what others did. But I get more
    and more freedom to untangle myself from a negative past,
    negative behavior, and negative thoughts. This has made my life
    extremely more beautiful.
       I don't have to be overwhelmed by feelings anymore. It's eas-
    ier for me to let go. I am able to make more room between my
    feelings, my thoughts, and my behavior, room that is necessary
    to choose. I don't always succeed in making the right choices. I
    still have my dramas and my panic. I am a human being and not
    perfect. But I can see a lot of progress, and I am very grateful.
       I'm blessed. I am in a happy relationship in which I learn
    healthy ways to deal with confrontation. I have friends. I am
    able to give love and to receive love. I am an addict. That is no
    longer a handicap, but a drive to shape my life in a positive way.
    So much has changed since the day when I wanted to die and
    that man showed me I was worth caring about. I didn't even feel
    worthy of the sandwich he made, but I did feel like I belonged in
    NA, and I do. It is important for me to remain watchful; the dis-
    ease is here and will remain, so my recovery should continue as
    well. I learn more and more to trust the endless love and power
    that lie in the spirituality of the program.

  I am no longer a victim of others, or of myself. I don't have to
use anymore, no matter what happens. I am responsible for my
recovery. If I fall back into an old feeling of self-pity, then I have
the means to deal with it. I am not alone; I have people to support
me when I ask for it. When I have a moment of despair, there will
always be someone to talk to. It's not always going well, but it is
always getting better.

    This addict from Iran was "the most important person in the
   room" for two years before he got clean. Now he devotes himself
             to NA--sponsorship, the steps, and service.

The Spirit of Service

I am an addict from Iran. I was introduced to NA in 1996 at a
detention house. This introduction led to a new way of life, not
out of willingness but out of powerlessness and desperation. I
had arrived at the center nearly unconscious and slept for two
complete days. I had smuggled in some drugs, but when I went
to use them, they were gone. It seemed to me that all my room-
mates were high, even though they all denied it. I was very agi-
tated and disappointed. I endured the pain without complaining,
but the desire to use was with me the whole time I was there.
  Now that I have been clean for a number of years, I am able to
see there was evidence of the disease of addiction long before I
started using. I didn't like my own belongings or even my par-
ents' names; I always wanted to be someone else. I wanted to be
powerful, capable, and prestigious. I wanted to be a grown-up.
  At age eleven, I smoked my first cigarette. It burned my
throat badly, yet I felt like a man. It helped my self-esteem for a
moment, but soon those feelings went away. At thirteen, I was
introduced to drugs. I immediately felt that I had found a way
to create feelings of power and control in me. The more I used
or the more powerful a substance I used, the better I felt. By the
time I was sixteen, I was using the most powerful drugs around.
For the first three years I enjoyed it. Gradually, one hit at a time,
drugs became my higher power. Day by day I was getting older
and weaker, while the drugs seemed younger and stronger.
  I started thinking about controlling my drug use. On every
attempt, the drugs defeated me. I would use to sleep; instead I
stayed awake. I would use to stay awake; instead I'd fall sleep.
I would use to find friends; instead I'd find enemies. I used


                                 208

                                                        Coming Home 209


to fight; instead I made up. Everything was controlled by the
drugs. I felt shame and guilt and would regularly judge and
punish myself. Denial, justification, and dishonesty created dis-
tance between me, my family, and the rest of society. My feelings
of anger, resentment, and hatred fueled my justification for us-
ing more and more.
   I have experienced much hardship due to my addiction: many
different jails, mental hospitals, suicide attempts, theft, and selling
of my family's belongings. One of the most painful experiences
happened during the 1984 war. At that time, many everyday
products were rationed and we had to use government-issued
coupons for our purchases. On a number of occasions, I sold the
rations of my baby's powdered milk on the black market and
used the money for drugs. After getting high, I would cry and
beat myself up. Sometimes I would feed my baby only sugar wa-
ter. My heavy using lasted twenty years; for the last seventeen,
I was looking for a cure that I couldn't find, until finally in that
detention house I was introduced to NA.
   Upon my arrival at my first NAmeeting, the greeter welcomed
me with a warm and loving hug. I was lost and confused. It had
been a long time since anyone hugged me--even my mother. I
thought, "These people are lunatics. They don't know who they
are dealing with." I was looking for differences and finding fault
with the meeting. Eventually there was a part of the meeting
where people announced their clean time. "This is not possible;
they are all lying; they are all high," my head was screaming.
Even in prison I would use anything I could find to get high.
   That was and will remain one of the most sacred days of my
life. They told me the newcomer is the most important person
in an NA meeting. For the next two years I was the most impor-
tant person in every meeting, since it took two years for me to
get clean. I thought that I was different. I thought maybe there
was another way for me to use if I could change the type or the
amount or the timing of my drug use. I continued struggling un-
til the miracle happened for me as well.

       One day, on the way to my connection, something amazing
    happened: Somehow I turned around and went to visit one of
    my NA friends instead. We talked only for a few minutes about
    ordinary stuff. But when I left I felt different. My obsession had
    disappeared. To this day I don't know what happened in those
    few minutes; what I do know is that was the beginning of my
    recovery. All that I had done was continue going to meetings,
    wholeheartedly asking God to help me stay clean, and I kept in
    touch with other NA members. Against my every belief that this
    program would not work for me, it did. I started feeling intense
    hope instead of my usual obsession to use. It seemed like I had
    become a different person with a new set of feelings who was
    about to begin a new life. I felt excited and happy and the world
    seemed beautiful to me.
       That same night I got a sponsor and told him that I wanted to
    work the First Step right away. He told me to read the First Step a
    few times so we could talk about it later. I stayed up until morn-
    ing and read all of the Basic Text. Starting the next day, I carried
    the book around with me and continued reading it. Every time
    I reviewed the First Step, something new would become clear. I
    couldn't believe that I could stop using, but the truth was that I
    no longer had an obsession to use. I spent most of my time with
    people in the fellowship and became more and more hopeful. I
    could truly laugh and feel joy. I looked at the sky, and it seemed
    that I hadn't really noticed it in years.
       Every day I shaved, put on clean clothes, and was the first one
    at the meeting. I shared at meetings and afterwards would spend
    time with other addicts. I no longer denied my problems, be-
    cause I felt that everything would be okay. I would call my spon-
    sor over ten times a day. He was patient and treated me like a
    good friend. It was a curious thing; for the first time I was willing
    to listen to someone unconditionally. I had become teachable.
    And I kept feeling and getting better. After a couple of months
    clean I ran into one of my old using buddies. We would talk for

                                                        Coming Home 211


hours when we were using. But this time we had nothing to say
to each other. It was as if we were strangers.
  From the beginning my sponsor made me aware that this was
only the beginning and that I needed to get into action. He told
me that to stay clean I need to work the steps, go to meetings,
and be of service. At first I couldn't understand what he was tell-
ing me. I was clean after many years of trying; I felt happy. How-
ever, after a short time I realized that if I didn't make some major
changes in my life soon, I would go back to where I was before.
Today I believe that a person who is clean and has not worked
the steps can possibly be more dangerous than someone using.
  When I started service work, I realized how sick I was. At-
tention seeking, self-centeredness, selfishness, resentment, the
desire for revenge, and many of my other character defects got
in the way and caused problems for other members. One day at
a time, our fellowship continued its growth, and I grew up and
got wiser as well. A little at a time I got in touch with humility,
God-centeredness, acceptance, forgiveness, and other spiritual
principles.
  At that time in Tehran there were only two groups, and each
met three times a week. I helped out by making tea, setting up
chairs, and cleaning up afterwards. I started feeling that this was
my home, and every time a newcomer arrived, I would go talk to
him and share my experience. I noticed the positive effect of my
words, and that made me feel good. I felt useful. People started
asking me to sponsor them, but my sponsor suggested that I
work some more steps before doing so. He said that meanwhile
I should continue to share my experience in recovery with oth-
ers. Gradually, by working the steps, sharing, and working with
newcomers, the spirit of service grew in me. I became thirsty for
service in NA. Today I recognize that service is my responsibility
and my way of appreciating the fellowship.
  My relationship with God improved. In the beginning I simply
prayed and thanked God for being clean, and that was enough to

212 Narcotics Anonymous


    give me a sense of serenity. Through working the steps I realized
    that as I kept changing and getting better, the world around me
    also kept changing for the better, and that God was with me on
    this path of transformation. I started to know myself and became
    familiar with my strengths and weaknesses. My relationships
    with people and my community kept improving. I found the
    ability to resolve my problems one by one. I experienced a new
    sense of peace and freedom by practicing the spiritual principles
    contained in the steps, and that helped me be more successful in
    my work. My faith helped me to recognize that my pain or de-
    feats were possible lessons for future success.
      Prayer and meditation became part of my life. The first time
    I worked the Eleventh Step my sponsor asked me if I'd ever
    thought about what God's will was for me. After a few days of
    considering this, the answer came to me that God's will for me
    was to serve others. When I shared this with my sponsor, he
    smiled and told me that now I was ready for the Twelfth Step. I
    believe that I truly became a member of NA once I worked the
    Twelfth Step. My sponsor suggested that to work the Twelfth
    Step better, I should increase my knowledge of how the program
    works. He encouraged me to attend meetings focused on the tra-
    ditions and concepts of service. I read service material. I gained
    a better understanding of spiritual principles and a better under-
    standing of my defects, which were obstacles in the way of my
    sincere service. Practicing spiritual principles has helped my life
    outside of the fellowship as well--to the point that today I am an
    economically and socially successful person.
      The NA program offers us only one promise: freedom from
    active addiction. Every day I thank God I have received this and
    so much more. Today I do not need to use drugs and do not need
    to die. I feel a loving God with me at every moment. I feel good
    about others and myself. I no longer need to seek approval or
    recognition. Serving NA is my way of repaying the fellowship
    that saved me from certain death, and doing service is a part of

                                                    Coming Home 213


my amends to society for the damage that I caused during my
using. Service is gratitude in action, and it gives me a feeling of
usefulness that is extremely meaningful to me. Every day I ask
God to give me the power to carry out his will.

         found grace out of the spotlight, in the rooms of NA.

A Brazilian Full of It!

Narcotics   Anonymous rescued me from the depths of despair
and gave me back my life. I was born in Rio de Janeiro and grew
up in the north of Brazil in a big family. My father was angry and
full of morals, but my mother was gentle and really good to us.
Life was difficult, but I felt loved. We were taught to love others
and be responsible. I thought of myself as special.
  I was seventeen when I got drunk for the first time. I hated the
taste but loved the way it made me feel. It was like the doors of
the universe were opened to me. In l974 I started dancing with a
folklore company and was introduced to marijuana by another
dancer. I absolutely loved the way I felt: Something was glowing
inside me, making me feel strong. After that first one, I wanted
another and another. When we went to smoke he took me behind
the theater and told me not to tell. The secrecy was very exciting.
The progression to other drugs came soon.
  We traveled in Europe, and even without speaking other lan-
guages, we found drugs. I became more and more dependent on
using. I was invited to stay in London and join a Brazilian the-
ater company. Most of the actors used, and I felt at home. In the
play all the actors were nude onstage. The first night I got really
loaded to be able to take all my clothes off.
  When the company went back to Brazil I stayed in London.
I spent all my money on drugs and wound up living in a squat
with other addicts, stealing from shops to eat, dancing topless
for money. I experimented with acid with another addict--I tell
you, we got more than we asked for. I got pregnant, and the de-
cision to have an abortion was like deciding what to eat: There
were no feelings (today when I think about it, I feel a lot). Two

days after the abortion I was introduced to cocaine--that love
affair lasted more than ten years.
  The dance company was rehearsing another show, so I went
back. I took LSD with me to sell. It was crazy, but I was so ar-
rogant I never thought about consequences. In Brazil I started
dealing. I knew it was dangerous, but I felt invincible.
  I was approached by a buyer, and we arranged to meet. I was
set up, and I am alive today only because I mentioned a friend
one of them recognized. When they left I was shaking, my heart
beating so fast I thought it would explode. One of them got ar-
rested, and someone told me that the police were looking for a
woman with red hair--that was me. I shaved my head.
  I got pregnant again and had another abortion. In Brazil that
was very difficult. I went to a backstreet doctor and contracted
an infection. I was in pain, and I had to tell my mother so she
could take me to a private doctor. I knew my mother was suffer-
ing, and my sisters were all angry. My family didn't know how
to deal with me. They didn't know what was going on, but they
knew it was serious. I was stealing from them to get drugs. I
was so unhappy, a figure of despair, in denial, lying, pretending
things were okay. Everything that I did, I did like there was no
tomorrow. I was powerless.
  At the end of the next tour I stayed in London again and met
the man who would become my love, my husband, and my
hostage. I moved in with him. I was so happy that for a while
I didn't use much. My boyfriend was supporting me. I looked
after the flat, studied English, and sewed to make money. We
were happy.
  We went to a crazy party--they had everything. That night,
my boyfriend couldn't find me to go home. I returned two days
later with an excuse. I started using cocaine again, smoking grass
every day, and becoming unreliable. My boyfriend was taking
such good care of me, and I was behaving so badly. I didn't see
what was happening, but I started using more and more and
hiding it from him.

       I got a contract to work as an entertainer in Cannes, Monaco,
    and Nice. The show was in the evenings. All we did during the
    day was go to the beach and use. I was high all the time. I discov-
    ered my addiction to gambling. I could not stop until I lost all the
    money I had taken with me and all the drugs were gone.
       I had an affair. I felt guilty, but I was an addict wanting more
    of whatever was available. I was using cocaine all the time. One
    night I used so much before the show that I couldn't sing; my
    voice didn't come out, and my nose started bleeding. I had to
    leave the stage. That had consequences for the whole group, but
    I didn't care. When the manager came to talk to me, I flirted with
    him until it was forgotten.
       In 1980 I went to work in the Caribbean. One night after the
    show I went out on a yacht with a man. We used a lot. He passed
    out. I was half-conscious, and I knew something was wrong. I
    could feel my heart beating inside my mouth, and my left side
    was paralyzed. I thought, quite calmly, "I am going to die." Then
    I thought, "I don't want to die," and I realized to my horror that
    we were in the middle of the sea. I was losing my senses. I felt
    really frightened. I prayed to God not to let me die. I promised
    that I wouldn't use again. Somehow I was able to turn on the
    shower, and the cool water helped the circulation return. When
    I got back to where I was staying, one of the musicians was
    using. He offered and I took. I was powerless, and my life was
    unmanageable.
       When my boyfriend met me at the airport he didn't recognize
    me. He was horrified; he said I looked like death. I had lost a lot
    of weight. For the next two years I did weekend shows in differ-
    ent cities, taking my drugs with me. Sometimes I was aware of
    the madness: It was like my body was twisted, my hands grip-
    ping the glass so tight that it would break. I was unmanageable,
    confused, and unhappy.
       My boyfriend asked me to marry him, and we went to Brazil.
    Even on my wedding day I was high. I was just able to stand

through it all, not embarrassing him or my family too much. My
last year of using was a nightmare. I stopped performing or even
taking care of myself. I didn't care what anyone thought. I would
go to dealers and come home days later.
  I was called to do a gig in Paris and thought I could do with
a change of scene. After the performance I went out, and to this
day that evening is a total blackout. On my way back to London
I stood out like a sore thumb, in a tight leopard-skin dress, at-
tracting attention. I was arrested in the airport in London. I was
really angry. I didn't know why they were arresting me. I had
this policeman saying to me how bad using drugs was, and in
my head I was saying, yeah, yeah.... That was the beginning of
the end of my using. It was August 1986.
  My recovery journey began when a friend took me to an NA
meeting. We had used together, and he was nine months clean. I
was very sick, very thin, and didn't know if I was coming or go-
ing. My husband sent me to a treatment center. I didn't feel hu-
man. In place of me there was a huge pool of arrogance, denial,
delusions, fear, pain, despair. It was more than I could bear.After
being in treatment for three months, I left, waving my middle
finger at everyone.
  Having been abstinent for three months and having gone to
NAmeetings, even reluctantly, it was clear to me that I was done
using. But I had to make sure. Everything I had heard in meet-
ings was true: My short, devastating relapse left me with feel-
ings I couldn't understand, and I went back to treatment. It was
hard to go back, but I am grateful for having found courage and
determination to stay and really look at the disease that wanted
me dead. The emotional pain was intense, and there were mo-
ments when I thought I was going to die, but the love and care of
other addicts helped me to carry on and to take it a day at time.
Sometimes I could only take it a minute at a time, and that was
okay too.
  Surrender allowed me to slowly return to humanity. I recog-
nized that I was dead inside. I was physically, spiritually, and

218 Narcotics Anonymous


    mentally sick. I decided to stop fighting and let people in, and
    bit by bit I was restored to sanity. I went into a halfway house for
    women. My first thought was, "But I hate women!" I told that
    thought to go away, and it worked (I do that a lot). I began to look
    at my anger, self-pity, and denial about what I did when I was us-
    ing. Trusting the process, using the program, being helped and
    helping others, I found that I had compassion and that I cared.
       When I did Steps One, Two, and Three for the first time it was
    like switching on the light. I started waking up every morning
    with this new feeling inside me--hope. Writing Step Four was
    definitely a turning point. I was able to face all the rubbish and
    start to recognize the good in me. I realized that I could nourish
    it and become a better person. There was a lot of work to do, but
    I wasn't afraid to let go, grow up, and go forward!
       Going through Step Five, sharing with another human being
    the true nature of my wrongs, is one of the most humbling things
    I've done. The day I did Step Five it was raining; the sky was cov-
    ered in dark clouds. Afterwards I went for a walk on the beach.
    It was really cold, and I was crying. When I looked up there was
    a patch of blue in the sky and the sun shone for a minute; for me
    that was my Higher Power saying to me that I was going to be
    okay. I felt happy, a spiritual awakening....
       Narcotics Anonymous is in my life. It has allowed me to see,
    to feel, to be the real me, and to achieve great things over the
    years. I could not be where I am today if I didn't practice prayer
    and meditation. My Higher Power is loving, kind, and truly my
    friend. I learned to accept my life as it is, not as I would like it to
    be. Working the steps is still a primary purpose in my life. I love
    going to meetings and growing. I like talking to other addicts
    and always have time for the newcomer.
       Recovery gave me the opportunity to become a mother, one of
    the most wonderful things that has happened to me. Life is not
    perfect. When my daughter was three years old, she was diag-
    nosed as autistic. Through the years she has been a real challenge.

She is lovely and we can have fun together, but at times she is
impossible to live with. I am lucky to have such a supportive
husband. We've been married for twenty years, and when I can't
cope, he takes over. My daughter is sixteen now, and we have
a son who is thirteen. The program helps me with my life and
its challenges. Today I believe that everything is going to be all
right. I have some very difficult days, but I have tools to help me
see the way through.
   When I came to recovery I was emotionally and spiritually
dead. It was like I was in a deep, dark hole. I could not see any-
thing, no hope, only despair. Going to meetings, sharing, things
started to make sense. I learned from other people's experiences.
Being willing to shut up and listen, doing service, having the
courage to leave my safe environment, I changed. Before I knew
it I was out of that hole for good, with huge prospects for my life.
I practice the Twelve Steps daily, and am grateful that today I can
admit when I am wrong. I can learn from my mistakes. I am not
so hard on myself anymore.
   I am eighteen years clean. My recovery journey is full of won-
derful happenings. I love my life, my sponsor, and my sponsees.
I have my own business. If someone had told me when I came
into recovery that I would be able to manage my own business,
I would have thought that they were joking. NA also helped me
go back to singing. I was invited to share at a convention, and
when I finished everyone asked me to sing. I didn't know what
to do, but they kept shouting, sing, sing, and to my surprise, I
started singing and I loved it! Thanks, NA. With the help of the
steps, a Power greater than myself, sponsorship, and service, I've
been able to see my potential. I've found me.

           When he reached the point where he couldn't live
             with or without drugs, this Australian addict
            attempted suicide. He survived through grace,
           and now he's been clean more than sixteen years.


Another Chance to Live

In the life of every addict there are crossroads: times when we
could stop using and take responsibility for our lives, if we make
the choice. I went through the crossroads one day in the bus sta-
tion toilets, and chose the wrong path. I think I was supposed to
die, but by the grace of God, I was given another chance.
  I have been clean for sixteen years. I got clean when I was
twenty-two, so I have lived most of my adult life as an NA
member here in Australia. I have a full, rich life, thanks to the
program of Narcotics Anonymous.
  As an adolescent, I was governed by the compulsion to take
drugs. The results were trouble, violence, prison, and poor
health. My using was punctuated by legally required visits to
counselors, probation officers, psychologists, etc. Rarely could I
hear what these people were saying--or hear anything above the
rumbling din of self and the desire for drugs. I was so focused on
getting what I thought I needed that I ignored most of the moral
boundaries most people take for granted. I stole, lied, cheated,
scammed, robbed; in the end, I was exactly what the Basic Text
says: "reduced to the animal level." I hunted the streets like a
wolf, looking for money and drugs. Deep inside I still had a con-
science, but I couldn't access it; I couldn't afford to. It was bur-
ied under a pile of emotional rubble. The task of cleaning up all
that rubbish was too great. There were too many things to deal
with to live a normal life. My life became a misery of unresolved
responsibilities.
  I believe every human's real job is looking after themselves,
and I couldn't seem to do that. Eating, sleeping, drinking water,

                                 220

                                                         Coming Home 221


exercising, staying warm or clean seemed irrelevant and virtu-
ally impossible. The result was a vicious cycle of hunger, poor
hygiene, and bad health. Between the layers of self, these inabili-
ties hid a particular emotional pain that I carried. I couldn't feel
it or articulate it properly until I got clean. I don't know whether
I brought this pain from childhood or whether it came into the
world with me, but I still carry it. It's not always present, but it
arises from time to time as I move through these layers. If I get re-
jected, left out, treated as second best, or am not wanted in some
way, the pain can become acute. I used to medicate this pain with
drugs. For a long time they made me feel better, but in the end
the drugs became their own particular pain. They drove me to
the edge of sanity, to the brink of death, and now I no longer see
myself as having that option. For me, using drugs is suicide.
   When I was twenty years old, I spent time in a maximum-
security prison for burglary. In there I saw some of the most
brutal human behaviors that I have ever witnessed. After two
excruciating years, I was released, with an absolute commitment
to stop using. I lasted for one hour before I was stoned on about
four different drugs and went into a blackout. My life spiraled
out of control for the next few months. My powerlessness was
evident, unmanageability undeniable. I woke up from a black-
out with blood on me that wasn't mine; I had a pocket full of
money and no recollection. I was frightened about what I was
becoming.
   One night I was trying to sleep through withdrawals. I had
taken some heavy tranquilizers, but they hadn't worked prop-
erly. I was in a stupor of frustration and futility. The pain of my
whole wretched life was caving in on me. I worked myself into
a weeping, cursing, violent rage, smashing the room, scratching
and punching at my own face. My housemate was terrified and
called my parole officer.
   The following day, an intervention was done by my parole
officer, a counselor, and my mother. They told me they were

222 Narcotics Anonymous


    going to send me back to prison unless I went to NA and did
    ninety meetings in ninety days. I said I would do whatever they
    wanted. They told me that wasn't good enough: I had to make
    choices for myself, because recovery couldn't occur until I really
    wanted to change. I was caught in a limbo of conflicting desires.
    Of course I wanted to change, but I couldn't; I wanted to use, but
    I couldn't. I felt there was nothing left to do, so I decided to kill
    myself. I left the intervention that day filled with a sense of abso-
    lute doom and desolation. I did a robbery, bought as many drugs
    as I could, and overdosed in the bus station toilets. I wanted to
    die because there didn't seem to be an alternative to the misery
    that my life had become. I went through the crossroads that day
    and chose the wrong path--but by the grace of God, I was given
    a second chance.
       I woke up a couple of hours later, crumpled on the floor of
    the toilet, completely defeated, my life a shambles. I walked,
    trudged, not knowing what to do or where to go. In that state
    of blind desperation, the winds of chance blew me into a detox
    center across the highway. They took pity on me and admitted
    me, even though I wasn't the required forty-eight hours clean.
    I lay naked, curled up on the bed, sobbing that night, feeling a
    particular sense of freedom, because deep inside I think I knew
    it was over. I had surrendered. I just didn't really know what that
    meant yet.
       At that detox they took people to meetings daily. I struggled
    through those painful first few days, but on a Wednesday night,
    at a meeting in a homeless center, I heard and felt the NA mes-
    sage for the first time. I didn't have to use drugs anymore; there
    was a way out. I was inspired by the other people who were
    clearly junkies but didn't seem to be using. They made me be-
    lieve there was a chance for me to really stop and have a go at
    life. I feel sad now, writing this; I am much more emotionally in
    touch with my old mad life now than I ever was back then.

                                                     Coming Home 223


   I couldn't imagine how life would play out. I just saw a black
hole of the unknown, but I had decided, just for the novelty, to
give it a go for a couple of days and see how long I could last.
   I lasted forty-nine days. Then I relapsed, and the compulsion
to take drugs was back on me like a ferocious animal. My life
spiraled immediately out of control again, and I realized that the
previous forty-nine days had been the most trouble-free in the
last ten years. The relapse lasted for about two months before
another detox and the death of another friend through overdose.
I have been clean now since the 25th of January 1989, and my
clean time is my treasure. I protect it with my life, because it is
my life.
   I have gone on to do many of the things that it seems to me a
person should do. I own a house and a business. I went back to
school and got an education. All the normal social and material
assets have returned. But more than any of that, I have loved--at
times deeply. I feel things--I feel everything! I guess I had al-
ways been scared of that, but it is amazing to feel, brilliant and
frightening, sad and awesome all at once. I am excited to be alive.
I am excited about what is to come. I still suffer with existential
angst from time to time, and wonder what we are all doing here
on this planet, but I have decided on a purpose, and that makes it
easier for me: I care about people getting clean. I have dedicated
myself to NA and to serving others. I attend meetings regularly.
I participate in the local area and the region. I sponsor people,
and I have an NA sponsor. I live the steps to the best of my abil-
ity, and I am trying to become the best person I can be. I believe
that by living like this we give others permission to do the same.
NA gave me the key to another life and this is it: "We keep what
we have by giving it away."

   She thought she was a traveler, but it was really a need to escape
      herself. This addict from Norway found her way home on a
                         Mediterranean island.

At the End of the Road

I came to my first NA meeting because of a twelve-step call.
It wasn't that I hadn't tried to stop using; I had done nothing
else for the last few years. But I tried by myself--my way. I was
traveling around the world, changing cities, countries, and con-
tinents. I would have changed planets if I could have. I tried ev-
erything to get away from drugs. I stopped on various occasions.
I substituted one drug for another. I tried changing boyfriends.
I had a baby, thinking for sure that would stop me from using.
But if I couldn't stop using for me, how could I stop using for
someone else? Nothing or no one could stop me.
   As far back as I can remember I have had a need to escape from
myself and my feelings. As a child I lived in the world of books
and fantasy in an effort to escape from emotions like fear, shame,
inadequacy, insecurity, inferiority, and oversensitivity. I became
someone else. I went away from my family as often as I could to
experience something different. I had to have excitement, some-
thing new all the time. I left home at sixteen years old. By that
time I had already started to use drugs. I joined the hippies in the
early seventies, and I left Norway and went to Denmark. I con-
tinued using, and I started to smuggle drugs because I was not
able to keep a job. I went on to India--on the hippie trail--and I
ended up at the "end station," which was Goa, in India. Here, I
was hanging out with freaks from all over the world. I could get
my hands on all kinds of drugs. I thought I had arrived in para-
dise. It looked like it from the outside, but there is no such place
as paradise for an active addict. The drugs turned against me. I
was imprisoned by my addiction, and I tried to get away time
and time again. I continued my criminal behavior and became an


                                 224

                                                     Coming Home 225


international drug smuggler. I ended up in jail, but I continued
using while incarcerated. I became an extravagant consumer of
drugs. I had developed a lifestyle of drugs, parties, and travel.
But the emotions I tried getting away from caught up with me:
The shame, fear, inferiority, despair, and loneliness only got big-
ger and bigger. I could not go on anymore. At one point I was
sure that I would die a using addict. I was close to death. I had
developed chronic bronchitis, and the attacks became more and
more frequent. One doctor told me I would die from this.
  This was the condition in which two members of Narcotics
Anonymous found me and brought me the message of recovery.
They saved my life. They told me I had a disease, and that recov-
ery was possible. I went to a treatment center and there started
to attend NA meetings. I moved back to my native country af-
ter having been away for nineteen years. While spending a few
months in the south of Europe, I had the opportunity to attend
my first local NA convention and my first regional European
convention. I went back to Norway, started an NA meeting in
my hometown, and became active in trying to spread the mes-
sage about NA to the public. I mostly sat by myself at this NA
meeting, but when I stopped listening for footsteps and instead
focused on the fact that I was there for my own sake, things went
much better. I was a member of NA, even if I was there alone.
  After one year I moved down south, still clean, and got in-
volved in an already-established NA community with a couple
of groups going. We formed a service structure, and slowly but
surely, NAstarted to grow in Norway. I started to work the steps,
and I also, slowly but surely, started to grow.
  I have the disease of addiction just as much today as I had a
few years ago. I am powerless, but I have a power greater than
myself in my life today who has helped me be restored to sanity.
Just for today, I no longer need to escape from myself and my
feelings. I hand my will and my life over to God as I understand
God, which has relieved me of trying to control people, places,

226 Narcotics Anonymous


    and things in order to get things to be the way I want them to
    be. It is up to God now--the results, I mean; the footwork is up
    to me. I attend meetings regularly, where I try to focus on bring-
    ing a message of recovery and giving back what other members
    so generously gave to me. I have had the opportunity to work a
    few Fourth Steps that have revealed my old, unhealthy behavior
    patterns. I got rid of the shame and guilt that had become such
    a burden. I had the opportunity to focus on my assets--parts of
    me that I did not know I possessed. I never in my wildest dreams
    imagined that I could share so honestly all of myself with an-
    other human being, my sponsor, in the Fifth Step. By sharing
    about myself, I found love and acceptance in the eyes of another
    woman. And by daring to be myself, I could start to like myself.
    I am just another human being with defects of character and
    shortcomings. What a revelation.
       Further, in the Eighth Step I made a list of people whom I had
    harmed, and I put myself first on the list. I hurt a lot of people,
    but none as much as I hurt myself. I had nothing but contempt
    for myself, so there was no limit to the pain I inflicted on myself.
    Others whom I hurt were usually people close to me. They were
    people I loved while I was charging through life with my self-
    centered need for instant gratification. I made direct amends to
    those people when to do so would not hurt them more. Instead of
    inflicting more hurt, I practice love, compassion, and forgiveness.
    My experience is that it is much easier to make direct amends than
    indirect ones, because the latter takes much more time.
       I keep on making amends to myself on a daily basis. I take
    care of myself today. I thank my Higher Power on a daily basis
    for my life and for my recovery. These are two gifts that it is up
    to me to take good care of. I do that by working NA's program of
    recovery and also practicing a healthy lifestyle. I have stopped
    filling myself up with chemicals. I eat healthy food, I rest, I do
    exercises, and I set boundaries where needed. I treat myself with
    respect and love today because I deserve it.

                                                       Coming Home 227


   In the Tenth Step I do a daily inventory, and I look at my be-
havior throughout the day. Today I'm more able to say, "I'm
sorry, my mistake," when I do not act according to my values. I
pray and meditate on a daily basis, and I try to act according to
God's will. I can often tell God's will today by the way things feel.
If an answer hits me like a bolt of lightning, it is usually my will.
If an answer develops over time, it is usually God's will. I am no
longer controlled by self-seeking behavior.
   This is what a spiritual awakening is like for me. I have gone
through a radical personality change as a result of working the
Twelve Steps. I am still actively involved in doing service. I con-
tinually work my Twelfth Step. I have a message to pass on to-
day, a message of recovery from the disease of addiction. I can
only keep what I have by giving it away, and there are many
ways I can carry the message.
   I was not clean during that first twelve-step call many years
ago on a Mediterranean island. As I put my small daughter to
bed that night, I took the last of my drugs. I sat on the kitchen
floor for hours, crying in despair. Those NA members told me
that my recovery was up to me. It was up to me to ask for help.
By the time I went to bed that night, I had made up my mind. I
wanted to be free of drugs. The process of surrender began that
evening, and when I awoke the next morning I had hope, for the
first time in years.
   I still like traveling and I still like hanging out with addicts.
I have had the opportunity to experience NA as a worldwide
fellowship. Before, I met using addicts from all around the world.
Now, I meet recovering addicts from all around the world. What
a difference and what a privilege.


                     Regardless of...

The disease of addiction does not discriminate, and neither
does Narcotics Anonymous. Our literature explains that NA is
open to anyone "regardless of age, race, sexual identity, creed,
religion, or lack of religion." No matter where we come from,
how we were brought up, or what we do for a living, NA's doors
are open to us. These members write about finding love and
acceptance in the program, and within themselves, even when
they least expected it.


      These members share briefly about finding recovery in NA
       "regardless of age, race, sexual identity, creed, religion,
                         or lack of religion."

Reflections

When    I came to my first NA meeting at the age of fifty-two, I
heard a woman say, "If there is anybody here for their first time,
please come to the front of the room and get a white keytag." All
sixty people turned around and looked at me. I went to the front
of the room, not knowing I was about to have the first physical
contact with another human being in over four years. The won-
derful woman who gave me the tag held me in her arms as if she
were holding one of her own children and whispered in my ear,
"You never have to use again." She gave me something I hadn't
had for many years--hope.
   Now I'm a senior citizen at sixty-five years old with thirteen
years clean, and a grandfather of two kids who teach me the
spiritual principle of unconditional love. To be able to do some-
thing for someone other than myself has been the most reward-
ing experience of my life.


Iam   an Eskimo, born and raised in the dark, frozen north. When
I wore my hand-sewn parka my mom made, the kids would
tease me. I hated my parka, my mom, my ethnicity, and myself.
Drugs took the edge off and helped me forget. Eventually, I left
with a scholarship my tribe offered. My disease progressed, and
I spent most of my money on drugs. A friend I considered to be
worse off than me said he was going to an NA meeting. I asked
if he wanted me to go for support, and I went. Little did I know
I would relate to all the readings and things others shared. I felt
so good when I left that first meeting.



                                  231

232 Narcotics Anonymous


       So much has happened since then. For a long time, I could not
    share in front of others. With my sponsor's help and by work-
    ing on myself, I've been able to share over a dozen times. That is
    amazing. Working the steps and going to meetings have helped
    me get better with myself, my culture, and my ethnicity. Today I
    am proud of who I am.



    The   first time I shared in a meeting about being gay was very
    hard. I had five years clean and regularly attended the same
    meeting. I never spoke about being gay. I referred to my boy-
    friends as "she" or "her" whenever I talked about my relation-
    ships. I was asked to share my story at a large meeting and knew
    that my newfound honesty demanded I share the truth about
    me.
       The night I was scheduled to speak, my sponsor unexpectedly
    brought his wife, who is not a member, to the open meeting. She
    had invited me to her home many times for dinner and is a de-
    vout Christian woman. I didn't want her to know that I was gay. I
    was afraid she would reject me. I prayed to keep my commitment
    to share openly that night. Despite my fear, I told my story hon-
    estly for the first time. When I finished, she looked directly at me
    and gave me a big, beautiful smile that said everything was fine.
    People came up to hug me, and no one teased or ridiculed me for
    being gay. From that time on, I knew I could recover as a gay man
    in Narcotics Anonymous.



    As  a Native American, I was taught that I was born with a spirit
    and I was blessed with seven guardian spirits. In my active ad-
    diction, they scattered and could not help me until I was willing
    to help myself. What I came to believe is that addiction is a liv-
    ing, breathing disease that will take what one loves the most. It

                                                        Regardless of... 233


will tear one's life apart until all is gone. I recall telling my hus-
band, in despair, that my spirit had left me.
   I was eventually banished from my land and my tribe. I was
facing over two years in prison. I was tired, and I wanted change
with all my heart. My deceased sister came to me in spirit and
said, "You can stay clean now." I believed her. With NA, I have
been able to humble my life. I have made amends to all the peo-
ple and my ancestors in public. In an open vote, the tribe chose
in my favor, and I now have my people back. My spirit has sur-
vived, thanks to my recovery.



Iwas  raised in a sincere, devotional religious family. The church
was the center of my social life, and I attended religious schools.
However, I didn't fit in well, even when I wanted to. I got preg-
nant out of wedlock, and this devastated my family. I saw my
dad cry for the first time. I chose to go forward with the preg-
nancy, partly due to my religion and also because I cared for the
father. I gave birth to a beautiful boy and relinquished him to
another family. The painful truth is that I succumbed to pressure
from family, church, and society.
   After college I discovered drugs, and my run didn't end until I
was mentally and spiritually destroyed. I landed in treatment and
found a woman who would be my sponsor for the next nineteen
years. At around eight years clean, I felt a lack of spiritual growth.
I came into contact with a spiritual leader of a tradition from India.
I began to study that path and experienced the sensation of being
in love with God. I was afraid that the NAFellowship would reject
me because of my dedication to this path, but my community was
surprisingly supportive. More recently, I have been developing
in a spiritual tradition not from India but from Mexico. I have a
teacher who has been showing us a way that honors the spirit and
the earth. I have assets that are beginning to reawaken, and I am
rediscovering a long-sleeping part of myself.

       Several years ago I found the son I had given up for adoption.
    It is very strange and wonderful. I am not the mother I might
    have been had things been different. It is best described as "inti-
    mate strangers," and it is an ongoing story.



    It  took two months of being clean and actively involved with
    NA and the steps before the obsession to get high was lost. And
    it's never come back. As an atheist, I looked to other addicts in
    the program as "the power of example." I understood power to
    be the ability to effect change. I saw power in those around me
    who were clean and enjoying the world they lived in and seek-
    ing solutions to their everyday problems. And to me, seeing is
    believing.
       Everything I've learned in recovery has been from other ad-
    dicts, those with similar problems who worked to overcome
    them. I do the same things as other members, except I don't be-
    lieve in prayer. I believe that if prayer worked, there would be
    no unhappy people in the world. Yet NA does work, as long as I
    involve myself in the steps and traditions as a way of life.

    After a lifetime of feeling different, this lesbian addict found the
            key to connection in a common needs workshop.

Finally Connected

Ispent   many years struggling against the overwhelming tide of
active drug addiction. As a lesbian, I felt hated and thought that
life could never offer me the things that seemed to come so easily
to others. Convinced that my sexual orientation was the ultimate
problem with my life, I grew angrier and more defiant toward
people and institutions every day. Alienation, legal problems,
shame, guilt, loneliness, degradation, and despair reached such
a frenzied cycle that eventually suicide seemed like the only op-
tion. From a hospital emergency room, I was referred to a treat-
ment facility.
   I was introduced to the program through members who fa-
cilitated Narcotics Anonymous meetings in the treatment cen-
ter. My only contribution to these meetings was the resentment,
anger, pain, and hopelessness that surfaced nearly every time I
shared. The meeting facilitators were always telling me things
would get better. Although I fought it every step of the way, the
caring and concern they showed stayed with me.
   Eventually, I began to listen to what other people shared dur-
ing the meetings. The group readings interested me in spite of my
feeling that I was different from everyone else. I started to look
forward to these meetings for temporary relief from my pain,
confusion, and fear. One day I realized that I was staying clean;
I welcomed this change like a drowning person discovering a
float. This was my "signing on" to the program. I understood
that the only way to avoid returning to the cycle of destruction
I left on the streets was to replace it with recovery, and I uttered
the words "I am an addict" with new understanding.
   As I stayed clean, more privileges were granted to me in the
center. I attended outside meetings, spent time with addicts

236 Narcotics Anonymous


    who were willing to come get me, and went to activities hosted
    by various NA groups. For the first time ever, I was living and
    having fun without having to use drugs. Life had improved dra-
    matically in such a short time, but I still lacked a real sense of
    belonging. Other addicts shared with me about being gay, but I
    thought that they avoided sharing this in the meetings because
    they were ashamed. I wanted to attend a gay and lesbian Nar-
    cotics Anonymous meeting to finally have my unique lifestyle
    and feelings of alienation truly validated. Finally, the center al-
    lowed me to attend a common needs meeting. I couldn't wait to
    explain to the group how ironic this title was for such a meeting.
    My needs were not common. I was a lesbian trying to work a
    program designed by straight people.
       I left that first common needs meeting disappointed; no one
    brought up the obvious fact that being gay was different from
    the norm. The meeting did not run any differently than any
    other meeting I had attended up to then, and I had expected it
    would. I returned every week, thinking it would be different, but
    the addicts there talked about the same things I heard in other
    meetings. It took some time for me to see that I was expected to
    get a sponsor, work the steps, and go to meetings just like ev-
    erybody else. When I finally found the courage to explain my
    indignation and disappointment to another gay recovering ad-
    dict, I got laughter in response. I was told that staying clean came
    first; the solutions to my problems would follow. I was amazed
    this person didn't recognize the injustice and hatred that gay
    people faced in our everyday lives. Getting clean was wonderful
    but could never resolve the real problems we confronted as gay,
    lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered individuals. I kept these
    feelings to myself, hoping that one day I could help another gay
    person to understand that it is possible to get clean despite the
    alienation and hatred we faced.
       Shortly after this resolution, the addicts who came to the
    treatment center excitedly announced there was going to be a

Narcotics Anonymous convention in the state. Their enthusi-
asm and willingness to support us at this convention won over
the center director. I found myself on my first out-of-town ad-
venture with one of the supporting staff. During our car ride I
learned that she was also a member of Narcotics Anonymous
and believed that, with the help of the fellowship, any addict
could successfully work the program and learn to stay clean. She
was part of the group responsible for this convention, and most
certainly for my attendance. We talked about staying clean all
the way there, and something inside me broke just a little bit. I
told her I was scared. Staying clean in the center was easier now,
but I was scared to think I would have to leave soon and stay
clean alone. That is when I heard the most profound thing ever
told to me by any recovering addict: In the Fellowship of Narcot-
ics Anonymous, you are never alone. I never wanted to believe
someone so badly.
  I was overwhelmed by the number of people at the convention.
I wasn't sure what I was feeling. The next day it was suggested
that I volunteer to greet and hug people at the convention. This
was difficult for me, but the other addicts didn't seem to notice
my awkwardness. Because I had no better ideas and nowhere to
hide, I did a four-hour shift.
  I attended the gay and lesbian workshop that afternoon. I was
thoroughly drained from hugging and greeting, and unable to
voice my frustration and discontent. My thoughts were cloudy,
and I had to work hard to fight back tears. I listened to every
drop shared at that workshop.
  Although the message had been shared at the other common
needs meetings I'd attended, this was the very first time I heard
gay and lesbian addicts talk about the internal struggle of learn-
ing to identify. I realized it wasn't hatred from society that kept
me from feeling connected; it was my own hatred I would have
to combat. No one had done as much harm to me regarding my
sexuality as I had done to myself by feeling unique, victimized,

238 Narcotics Anonymous


    and closed-minded. Finding my place of peace would have to
    come through working the Twelve Steps with someone who had
    knowledge and experience. Maybe I was just too tired to block
    out the message that afternoon. All I know is that I could no
    longer find the energy to intellectually battle with people who
    wanted to help me. This is when I truly began to feel my way into
    the program of Narcotics Anonymous.
      The experience at that first convention changed my attitude
    about my own life, and I craved that powerful feeling of unity
    and group spirit. My willingness skyrocketed. I was ready to
    find a sponsor, share my thoughts, do step work, and listen to
    others.
      After leaving the center I found myself volunteering for all
    types of service work: coffee-making, greeting, stacking chairs,
    talking with newcomers. I shared at meetings about my struggle
    to understand the steps, instead of about the things I found un-
    acceptable in the world. No one in NA has ever turned me down
    for a service position because of my sexual orientation. Women
    in Narcotics Anonymous have provided me the opportunity to
    sponsor them even though I'm a lesbian, and when I am looking
    for a sponsor, being gay has never been a condition. The belief
    that my sexual orientation would always be a wedge between
    me and others has melted away. My home group sent me to area
    service meetings, and I enjoy the opportunity to be involved at
    that level.After some time in service at the area, I joined the plan-
    ning committee for the very convention that sparked the change
    in my attitude.
      The opportunities to work with others and become a part of
    this fellowship have soothed the aching need I had to belong
    somewhere. Through working the steps and practicing the
    program of Narcotics Anonymous, I have discovered so much
    about myself. One of the gifts I have received is the deep desire
    to work with others. This is the medicine I apply to the old scars
    left by anger, fear, resentment, and alienation. My gratitude for

                                                   Regardless of... 239


this way of life cannot be expressed through words on a page;
it is expressed whenever I have the opportunity to help other
people on their journey of recovery. I thank the members of Nar-
cotics Anonymous for creating spaces like common needs meet-
ings where I can explore some of the feelings I dragged into the
program with me. I had no idea the solution would begin with
acceptance of myself. From this position I naturally developed
the capacity to accept and care about others. It is truly a "we"
program, and I have never been happier or more content than to
learn that I have always been just like everyone else.

      Addiction took him away from his Orthodox Jewish roots,
        but recovery helped him forge a new relationship with
                     a God of his understanding.


One Third Step for Me,
One Giant Leap for My Recovery

I was  born in 1954 and adopted at birth by an Orthodox Jewish
family in New York City. My parents were honorable people. My
father was a righteous, humble man, dedicated to his religion. I
couldn't have had better parents. They always told me the truth
about being adopted. Even though they loved me very much, I
felt abandoned by my natural parents. I believed that I was un-
usually lucky to have a family who loved me, but that I really
didn't deserve one. I felt different, alone, and less than. And I
knew there was something that I could do to make myself feel
better, only I didn't know what it was.
  I was raised in the traditional Orthodox way. We went to tem-
ple weekly, prayed three times daily, ate only kosher food, and
observed the Sabbath and the holidays. I learned to read Hebrew
at the same time that I learned to read English. I brought my
parents great joy as a youngster. When I was twelve years old, I
ran into a burning house and helped an old blind lady to safety.
I made the front page of the paper. My parents were very proud
of me. But all I wanted was to be the same as everyone else. We
dressed differently from other people, we acted differently, we
spoke a different language, and we ate different food. I really
wanted to be cool.
  Addiction was not learned behavior. I was an addict for as
long as I can remember. I first used fantasy to get out of myself.
I would dress up as Superman and run around with my arms in
front of me, as if I could fly. I badly wanted to be a superhero.
I was taught about the power of prayer: If I prayed at the right
time, in the right place, and with the right intention, my prayers

                                 240

would be answered. I prayed often that God would allow me
to fly and have superpowers. I wasn't going to use my powers
to rob banks. I wanted to help people in need. Yet God did not
let me fly. When I outgrew superhero costumes I "substituted
one for another," and started playing air guitar. Every day after
school I would go to my room, put on a record, stand in front
of the mirror, and play along with the band. I wasn't a Jewish
kid from the Bronx. I was the fifth Beatle. I was the sixth Rolling
Stone. Then my mom would call that it was suppertime, and I
had to go back to being me.
  Then one night my folks came home after an evening out to
find me passed out on the living room floor with an empty bottle
of my father's wine. I never played air guitar again. I had found
a new way to get out of myself.
  About that time, I read an article in a magazine about people
who took a particular drug, thought they could fly, and jumped
off a building to their deaths. Anyone else reading this article
would say, "I'm going to stay away from that," but not me. I said,
"Now I know how I am going to fly, after all." My thinking was
that they didn't die because they were using, they died because
they were stupid. "I'm gonna take that drug, and if I think I can
fly I'll start flapping my arms while standing on the ground,
then fly up to the top of the building." That was my logic.
  Before long, I strayed from my religious observances. Every
time I had to choose between my heritage and using, I painfully
and reluctantly chose using. I was drawn further and further
away, into a lifestyle I knew nothing about and didn't really like.
My father tried everything he could to help me stop using. He
would have done anything. As much as I respected and loved
my parents, the disease of addiction caused me to bring them
nothing but shame and sorrow.
  I used every day, switching from one drug to another, drifting
from one city to another. As I pushed people away, they began
to give up on me, and I began to give up on myself. Everything I
did ended in disaster. A failed marriage, a failed career, a failure

242 Narcotics Anonymous


    in every respect. I cleaned up for one day to attend my son's bar
    mitzvah, and in the middle of the reception I had to get back to
    the crack house. I had nothing left to live for. I was a stain on my
    family name. I was ashamed of who I had become.
       In December 1993, I finally checked into a detox. I weighed
    in at 112 pounds. My thighs and arms were the same thick-
                        11

    ness. I looked liked a concentration camp survivor. I was angry,
    arrogant, closed-minded, hateful, stubborn, and completely in
    denial. Boy, did they have their hands full with me. They tried to
    convince me that I had a drug problem, but using was my solu-
    tion for every problem I had.
       When I quit school because I was using every day, I didn't
    have a drug problem, I had an education problem. When I left
    my parents' house because I was using, I didn't have a drug
    problem, I had a family problem. When my wife left me because
    I was using in front of the kids, I didn't have a drug problem, I
    had a marital problem. When I sold the family car for a couple
    of "eightballs," I didn't have a drug problem, I had a transporta-
    tion problem. This was the condition of my denial when I was
    introduced to Narcotics Anonymous.
       I made it through detox and treatment, and ended up in a half-
    way house in upstate New York. I attended my first NA meeting
    the night I arrived. I raised my hand and said that I was new,
    and they sent a meeting list around the room to gather phone
    numbers from other members for me to call. I still have that list.
    It rode in my wallet for the first ten years of my recovery. Now it
    is laminated and I keep it in my living room. Every now and then
    I look at the names, and most of the people are still clean.
       I started doing service work very early in my recovery, and
    have benefited greatly from finding humility through service. I
    began working steps with my sponsor. For a long time I struggled
    with the Third Step. I couldn't understand the difference between
    spirituality and religion, and I had to establish a new relation-
    ship with a Higher Power. This struggle has been the greatest

    11Fifty-one kilograms

                                                      Regardless of... 243


challenge in my recovery. It has also been the most rewarding
experience of my life. My sponsor thought that I would work
through the Third Step in a few months and would start writing
my Fourth Step by the end of my first year. Instead, I spent almost
twenty months searching for a loving, caring Higher Power who
would "guide me in my recovery, and show me how to live."
   The problem was that my idea of a Higher Power was an old
man with a long beard who had a scorecard of my life in one
hand and a lightning bolt in the other. He was definitely going
to send me to hell. How could I possibly make a decision to turn
my will and my life over to him? Yet it was clear to me that those
people who had worked the Third and Eleventh Steps had a se-
renity about them which I did not have. I wanted that so much. I
had to find a new definition of a Higher Power. I searched the li-
brary, the Internet. I went on spiritual retreats. I went to services
in a temple and spoke to the rabbi. I spoke to a lot of people in the
fellowship about their Higher Power. Some of these were good
experiences, and some were not. I kept searching.
   Slowly, things began to change. I started talking regularly to
my Higher Power. I started seeing my Higher Power working in
other people's lives, and started thanking him for that. I started
seeing evidence that my Higher Power was working in my life.
I started to pray for other people, and I started seeing some of
my prayers being answered. Then I put a special time aside on
a regular basis to ask my Higher Power's help in my endeavor
to find him. And then one day, while I was meditating, I noticed
that my Higher Power was no longer carrying that lightning bolt
around with him.
   I slowly noticed myself changing. I started to see the good side
of everyone around me. I started to understand other people's
problems, and I prayed for them to find a solution. And after
building a relationship with my Higher Power and the NA Fel-
lowship, I couldn't see that scorecard in his hand, either. I came
to the revelation that I was a good person, and that I was not going

244 Narcotics Anonymous


    to end up in hell. It's hard for me to imagine now that a person
    can do hospitals and institutions service work and still think that
    he is going to hell.
      I am still on this journey. I am still growing. My love for my
    Higher Power is getting stronger every day. Something still calls
    me to return to my religion. I tried attending services again
    when a fellow addict invited me to go to temple with her on the
    holidays. It wasn't as bad as the last time. I am gradually getting
    more comfortable with my relationship with my Higher Power.
    I know that today I cannot return to the Orthodox religious
    practices of my youth. But I am coming closer and closer. My
    relationship with my Higher Power reminds me of a story my
    father used to tell about a father whose son had strayed away.
    One day, after many years, the father sent a messenger to find his
    son and tell him to return home. The son replied, "I can't." So the
    father sent the messenger back to say, "Then come as far as you
    can, and I will come to meet you the rest of the way." My Higher
    Power has come the rest of the way to meet me.
      I know today that my Higher Power is completely okay with
    where I am, but he continually places opportunities in my path
    for me to grow spiritually. These opportunities are often cleverly
    disguised as catastrophes. Either they can be experiences, or
    they can be learning experiences. It's up to me. I have a choice.
      I really am grateful for the program of Narcotics Anonymous.
    My life now has purpose. I love myself and everyone around
    me. I am grateful to my predecessors who saw to it that there
    was a seat for me, with a reading on it, in NA. I owe them a
    debt of gratitude. The only way I know to repay that debt is to
    get involved, and make sure that there is a meeting with a seat
    available for the newcomer today. I am so grateful that I have
    been able to stay clean. I reach out to newcomers, and I look for
    people who are struggling with their concept of a Higher Power,
    and share my experiences with them. Today, I am truly grateful
    that God did not let me fly. This program works.

           out of spite, but she stayed clean because of hope.

           and I am an addict.        and I am an addict.
Where    do I begin a story that I shouldn't be here to tell? I am a
Maori woman who came into this program kicking and screaming.
I was twenty-eight and had been court-ordered to attend a treat-
ment program in Auckland, New Zealand. I believed treatment
was a "get out of jail card" for me, and I would use when I left.
   I knew I was an addict when I first used alcohol at the age
of thirteen. After that first drink, I remember thinking, "Hey,
I really like this feeling," and then I proceeded to black out.
I binged for a while, drinking on Friday nights, but went
from using alcohol to smoking dope, to hitting the doctors
up for prescription drugs, to injecting hard drugs--wow, the
progression was fast. I was shocked at how quickly it happened.
By the time I was eighteen I was a single mum with a two-year-
old daughter living on welfare in public housing, using on the
government methadone scheme. From the beginning, my goal
was to be an addict. I loved the feeling of being out of it. I was
heavily involved in the criminal underworld, and the chaotic
lifestyle was exciting.
   My family loved me dearly, but I continually ripped them off.
All the promises I made to them were empty. "I promise I'll stop,
mum; just need some money to organize myself." "I promise I'll
turn up. I promise I will get help. I promise I'll be there for my

    little girl's birthday...." Yeah, right. My family knew my addic-
    tion was killing me, but I couldn't see it. They decided to care
    for my children to keep them safe from me. What a blessing that
    was.
       I tried to change. I moved, thinking new city, new start. I would
    get a couple of months, but once I started again I couldn't stop. I
    tried relationships to get clean, but I always chose addicts. I tried
    mental institutions, but they gave me more drugs. I tried find-
    ing god on my own, but that didn't work. I couldn't understand
    why I continued to use when my life was crumbling around me.
    Physically I was shot: I lost all my teeth and I weighed about six
    and a half stone. I was devoid of any concept of a higher power
                       12

    and my wairua was broken. I really only thought of one thing:
                                   13

    how I could use and get more drugs. I could not see any cure. I
    was an addict, and addicts use drugs, full stop. If that meant kill-
    ing myself in the process, then so be it.
       By the end of my using, it wasn't pretty: I was wanted by my
    so-called friends for ripping them off, my whanau didn't want to
    see me because all I brought was cops and trouble, and the cops
                                                         14

    just thought I was a nuisance addict who created a lot of paper-
    work; they wanted to put me away, out of their hair. I hated my-
    self and everyone around me. I couldn't even kill myself prop-
    erly; I would wake up in the emergency ward and think, "What
    the hell are you keeping me alive for?"
       I was sitting on the wrong side of a window at Auckland Po-
    lice Station, where my partner was trying to get me bail. He had
    brought our children with him and they were crying, wanting
    to know when mummy was coming home. My partner pleaded
    with me to stop using and to look at the pain I was causing our
    whanau. For that brief moment I told myself, this has to stop.
    Deep inside, I had had enough. The next day I appeared before
    the judge and was told to either go to treatment or go to jail.
    I thought I took the easy way out and chose treatment, but it
    would have been far easier to go to jail for three months than

    12Ninety-one pounds or forty-one kilograms.

go to all those groups! Who wants to find out how you really
feel inside? Who wants to find out that all the relationships you
had were based on nothing but your addiction? Who wants to
find out that you have an incurable disease, but that it can be ar-
rested? Not me!
   On my first day of treatment, I took the bus with all my suit-
cases to my dealer for a last taste. I arrived at the treatment facil-
ity an hour late. When I got there, the manager told me I was too
late--that 8:00 am was the time to come in. I was told to come
back a week later. I was furious that she could refuse me, an ad-
dict crying for help (stoned, actually), and I told her that this was
bull and I would show her! Out of pure stubbornness I set out to
prove that I could do this. That was the decision that saved my
life. I have been clean over nineteen years since that first day.
   The miracle that happens when one addict helps another is
without parallel. I started treatment not knowing what to expect.
Every morning I would wake up with my body screaming to use.
I would talk to myself and say, "For the next ten minutes I won't
use," and it would pass. Those ten-minute slots turned into days,
then weeks, and then months.
   Through NA I started to hear the message of hope. Slowly my
clean eyes saw people in the rooms who I had used with. These
people were no-hopers in my mind, and they had stopped using.
They looked happy. This gave me hope that maybe I could do it,
too. My muddled head started to get clearer as the drugs came out
of my system. I was learning to practice the steps in treatment and
soaking up all the healing that happens with addicts helping each
other, yet I still had reservations about staying clean. I didn't think
I could do it. I had no belief in myself. I graduated from treatment,
but out in the real world I was full of fear. I hung in there at all costs
because I was too scared to go back.
   I found that freedom from active addiction comes with a price.
I did everything that I was told to do. I left the love of my life
because he was still using, and I knew that I wouldn't stay clean

248 Narcotics Anonymous


    if I went back. I never hooked up with any of my using mates for
    fear of picking up. I gave up my house and all my possessions
    to move across town. I wanted to start a fresh life for myself and
    my children.
       I was told when I left treatment to get a sponsor, go to meet-
    ings, and don't use at all costs. To tell the truth, that's all I did. I
    went to meetings, worked the steps, and didn't pick up--even
    though every day for the first two years, my first waking thought
    was that I wanted to use drugs. After I had earned the respect of
    my whanau I was able to have my kids come live with me. I was
    still a single mum with small children living on welfare in a state
    house, but I was clean. I had NA meetings and our Twelve Steps
    to help me. I learned a valuable lesson: Thinking about using
    drugs does not mean actually doing it.
       I started to accept my powerlessness over addiction. The first
    two years of recovery were a grieving process for me. I grieved
    for my old lifestyle, I grieved to use drugs like wanting an old
    familiar lover, I grieved for my old friends, and I grieved for the
    rituals of using. Slowly, as I moved away from this grief by stay-
    ing clean a day at a time, I was letting my addict go. I felt empty
    inside.
       That's when I started to get a handle on the Second Step: "We
    came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore
    us to sanity." I so love this step! It allowed me to see that I needed
    to fill myself up with something else. NA meetings, my sponsor,
    the group, and working the steps would all help to restore me to
    sanity. Each day in those first two years was hard, but it was "a
    program of firsts"--the first time getting through feeding my-
    self and my whanau clean, the first time meeting with teachers
    and getting the kids to school clean, the first time paying bills
    on time clean, the first time opening a bank account clean, shar-
    ing in meetings clean, having coffee with other recovering ad-
    dicts clean, the first time I had sex clean (that's a biggie). Slowly,
    I started to change. I remember the first day I woke up without

having the desire to use drugs. It took two years, but the desire
was removed for that moment. Wow, that was a huge milestone.
For a moment, my sanity had been restored. I started to feel good
about who I was and where I belonged in this world.
   I started to understand the message of hope for this addict.
After that miracle, I decided to get off the dole by going back to
school, and got a degree in social work. I had left school at fif-
                                           15

teen, had no formal education, and thought I was a dummy--but
it was possible because I found the rooms of NA. My family was
pretty stoked as well, as I'm the only one in my family who went
to university. I have been a productive member of society for a
while now, holding down a straight "Mary tea-towel" job for the
last fifteen years of recovery. Sometimes it blows my mind: I'm
in these professional meetings thinking, "Is this really me?" I
pinch myself sometimes at the miracles in my life. I have the big-
gest gift: my children's company, respect, and aroha. That has
                                                       16

been truly a miracle. I bought my first house in recovery. I have
a wicked job that I love and get paid for. I got my driver's license
at thirty and have a car. I have money in my bank that I worked
hard for. I don't have to rob and steal to make ends meet. I am no
longer standing on street corners waiting for the man to turn up.
I don't have cops busting my door, and I have this unshakable
faith that all will be well, no matter what happens, as long as I
don't pick up, I go to meetings, and I trust my higher power.
   If you are reading this and are new to this program, please
give yourself a break. Go on, take it a day at a time, minute by
minute if need be, ring someone in NA, and get to a meeting
because I promise you there is hope for us addicts, and miracles
happen way beyond your wildest dreams.

      When she got clean at sixteen in Chicago, she had no way
  of knowing that more than twenty years later she would wind up
              in Italy, feeling how service connects us all.

Growing Up in NA

I made   it to NA for all the usual reasons, and thanks to the fel-
lowship and Twelve Steps, I've literally grown up in NA as NA
has grown up around me.
  I got clean in Chicago in 1983, when I was barely sixteen and
all the meetings in the metropolitan area could fit on just one
sheet of paper. Much of our literature hadn't been written yet,
we had poker chips instead of key chains, and my first Basic Text
was a photocopy of the literature approval version. There were
few women and no one else quite as young as I was in the meet-
ings I went to. At six months clean I was taking my shift answer-
ing the NA helpline from a pay phone in the halfway house for
juvenile delinquents where I was living.
  Looking back on it now, it seems like NA and I were both ado-
lescents who grew up together. It was a period of rapid expan-
sion in the fellowship--every weekend we traveled to meetings
or workshops, or planned social events, learning how to stay
clean together.
  How you identified yourself in a meeting became of the ut-
most importance--we were forging our own identity as a fellow-
ship, saying yes, we can recover in NA, just NA. There was no
avoiding service in those days, and being the addict that I am, I
was rather obsessively involved for the first nine or ten years of
my recovery. I was blessed to be a part of a lot of new beginnings:
opening an area service office, creating two regional service
structures, planning local and world conventions, developing
NA literature.
  What have I learned after spending more than half my life in
NA? Simply that the fundamentals are just that, fundamental.

There is no substitute for being of service, having a good spon-
sor, working the steps, and going to meetings. I was fortunate
in that I got clean so young that I have literally grown up with
twelve incredible tools for living--the steps. I have had to con-
front many difficulties during my recovery. But with the tools of
recovery I've been able to overcome and, even more importantly,
learn from and grow through all of it.
  When I had about ten years clean I moved to a very remote
Native American reservation where there were no NA meetings.
I was able to stay clean and continue to work the steps by main-
taining strong relationships with other addicts and my sponsor
(who I was with for fifteen years).
  Today I know I can do anything I choose to in life, as long as I
am willing to do the footwork. Working the program has helped
me become the responsible, productive member of society that
our literature talks about. I went from being a high school drop-
out to having a master's degree and working with Native tribes
nationwide in Washington, DC. I was still feeling jittery the first
time I had to get screened for White House clearance to meet the
president, until I remembered that I was a juvenile when I got
clean so my record would be clear! I have traveled all over the
world and gotten to do work that I believe in and that would
benefit others.
  I was back in Chicago for several months around my twentieth
anniversary. So many of my old crowd were no longer around,
for all the usual reasons: One was in prison, several dead, lots
using again, and a number still clean but not going to meetings
anymore. As I seem to do every year around my clean date, I was
examining my recovery and looking for reasons to keep going
to meetings myself. It seemed like I always had the most clean
time wherever I went, and I felt a real need to be around other
"oldtimers" and hear what made them keep coming back. Thank
goodness I did what I had been told to do all these years: I went
to meetings and I shared. I talked about my lethargy and doubts

    (including the classic "I got clean so young; maybe I wasn't re-
    ally an addict."). I actively sought out people with time and
    questioned them on where they found their motivation to con-
    tinue in the program. I reconnected with a woman I had known
    since she got clean fifteen years earlier, and we began working
    the steps together again. I did another Fourth Step inventory. In
    short, I followed the program's suggestions. What I got in return
    was another spiritual awakening and a new lease on my life in
    recovery.
      And now I am writing this from Italy. I have started a new
    career, something I love and that is just for me, and I am back to
    doing service in NA. I am an active member of my home group
    and Narcotici Anonimi in Italia. I have a sponsor, and I sponsor
    two amazing women. The program here seems very much like
    the NA I walked into many years ago, and I am excited and hon-
    ored to get to be a part of another growth cycle in NA, this time
    halfway around the world.
      Three years ago I attended my first Italian NA convention.
    Each meeting at the convention was based on an entry from the
    Just for Today daily meditation book. At my very first meeting
    I heard a man from Italy with fourteen years clean say that he
    read from it every day and it had helped save his life and keep
    him clean. I spontaneously burst into tears. When I was eighteen
    years old I was a regional literature chairperson and for two
    years coordinated what we then called the "daily book project."
    Every weekend we had editing workshops in my mom's base-
    ment where I would input the corrected versions in one of the
    very first personal computers.
      During this time I had never stopped to think about the im-
    pact we might have on someone else. I wouldn't realize it until
    years later when I was half a world away at a convention. There
    I heard another addict speak in Italian about his life changing as
    a result of the literature we were working on in my mom's base-
    ment. Today I understand how what we do in our own lives and

recovery can be felt around the world. Through NA and the ser-
vice we do for the fellowship, every single one of us is connected
in some way. Coming from a NativeAmerican tradition, I had al-
ways been taught that we are all related and interconnected, but
I never thought much about this early in my recovery because I
was so young and busy trying to stay clean and grow up. I now
understand why I need to keep coming back, no matter how
long I've been clean. I finally understand what my family had
been trying to tell me all those years. Mitakuye oyasin.

        At nine years clean, he was diagnosed with depression
   and schizophrenia, diseases he continues to treat with medication
      and therapy. This addict learned that while mental illness
      is an outside issue in NA, dealing with it in his personal
            recovery is very much an inside issue for him.


A Serene Heart

Iam  a grateful recovering addict who recently celebrated twenty-
five years clean through NA and the grace of God...and I live
with the mental illnesses of severe depression and schizophre-
nia. And yes, I've been blessed with a very fulfilling life. I have
noticed that many people who readily admit they are addicts
can't admit that they struggle with their mental health. There
are different levels of stigma attached to addiction and mental
illness. I understand the fear of admitting something unpleas-
ant. After all, as an NA member, I had to squarely face my fears
when I first owned up to being powerless over my addiction in
Step One. Later in my recovery, I learned that mental illness is
not something that can be hidden away or minimized. I have to
be honest and admit it, in and out of the rooms. Fortunately, the
paths of NA recovery are many. For those who live with perma-
nent, debilitating diseases in recovery, I hope my story will help
courage blossom within you.
   My earliest memories are of continual abuse and yelling, with
frequent visits to the hospital. I behaved differently from what
was "normal," and was diagnosed as mentally retarded and hy-
peractive. Consequently, I was accorded the kind of upbringing
prescribed for "special" children: social isolation, close supervi-
sion, and limited stimulation. In grade school, I spent half days
in special education programs. But when I was seven, I read
an entire encyclopedia in three weeks, plus numerous books
intended for adults. Suddenly they decided I wasn't mentally
retarded, just very hyperactive. But I still wasn't allowed friends

                                  254

and was kept from activities because of my acting out. Being iso-
lated, I developed a fantasy life.
   I first used drugs around this time, and using took away the
sense of alienation. Drugs allowed me to feel like I belonged to
something, even if it was just another fantasy. I smoked weed
and abused my prescriptions to cope with an alcoholic family
and a troubled social life. Not having friends at school, I felt like
it was always "them" and "me," the abnormal kid. I ran away
from home at twelve, beginning a cycle of living on the streets
and in communes. The first time I overdosed, I was fourteen.
Later, I robbed a convenience store at gunpoint for a book of
matches. I knew I was crazy, and the drugs made it okay.
   The fun times were over by the time I was fifteen. Sleeping
in dumpsters, freezing in garages, constant starvation, and self-
abuse accompanied my drug addiction. I drifted from one group
to another. I was constantly haunted by the feeling that I was
different from other people, that I was an alien walking among
the earthlings.
   I looked for companionship in psych units and rehabs, but no
girl would have anything to do with me. I certainly wasn't the
high school dating type. I wanted to be loved, but I tried to be-
lieve that using drugs made love unnecessary. I finally hooked
up with a girl I met at a rock concert. Using my homelessness
as an excuse to move in with her family, I ripped off her parents
and we took off for the streets. By that time, I was overdosing
every few weeks. One of those times I was hospitalized, and she
left. Feeling doomed, I tried to kill myself in a variety of ways.
Finally, I overdosed into a coma. At the hospital, they didn't
know who I was. I had no ID; I was found dying in an alley
somewhere. The doctors told me afterwards that the coma was
the kind people usually don't wake up from. No one had visited
me. No one cared. Full force, I felt the total emptiness in the heart
that comes from addiction. I had nothing for a life. I couldn't
even remember my name.

       At this point, when I was most hopeless, I was graced with
    the awareness that I wouldn't have to feel this way again if I did
    everything in my power to stay clean. I went to AA, and there,
    I ran into the only NA member in my community. When he ex-
    plained NArecovery to me, something clicked. Nothing else had
    worked for me, whether I was sincere or not. Could it be that I
    just wasn't around the kind of people who could really under-
    stand me? Together we started a meeting. By example, he taught
    me the value of being dedicated to my personal recovery and to
    NA. We'd drive hundreds of miles to support fellow addicts in
    other communities. I wrote out the steps, and practically lived
    and breathed recovery. I had absolute faith in Narcotics Anony-
    mous. I strongly believed I would be transformed into a better
    human being if I followed the path of recovery. By the time I had
    ninety days clean, I had started several meetings and was spon-
    soring newer members.
       Miracles happened. The spiritual awakening described in Step
    Twelve manifested in my life. I knew what it meant to be spiritu-
    ally awake, and I could live it. Not only did I stay clean, I lost the
    desire to use drugs, or even to behave like an addict. Addict be-
    haviors were as distasteful and spiritually empty as using drugs.
    Never having worked before, I was able to hold down a job at
    a treatment center. Starting off as a counselor, I quickly became
    an administrator. I served on service boards in and out of NA.
    God blessed me with leadership abilities, and I was filled with
    willingness to be of loving service. I went to ninety meetings in
    ninety days, every ninety days. Learning consistency this way, I
    was able to discover and cultivate my talents on behalf of the fel-
    lowship and in my professional life. Daily prayer and meditation
    brought balance in my life. I could have intense conviction, but
    convey myself to others with gentleness. I experienced love for
    the first time, the deep love for other human beings that comes
    from a soul that is serene.
       By the time I had eight years clean, I had a life that I could only
    have dreamed about. Not that I did it alone, of course; I had all

                                                     Regardless of... 257


the assets that come with NA recovery: a Higher Power, the ex-
perience of my fellow addicts, and the strength of their recovery.
Years of prayer and meditation were rewarded with a genuine
conscious contact with God and the awareness that I was partici-
pating in my Higher Power's plan. I had earned the respect of my
fellow NA members and the community. I even had a soul mate,
a wonderful lady who was clean in NA. I was living life, rather
than just surviving.
  But life changed. Over the next couple of years, I endured
many dark days. My wife dropped out of NA, started sleeping
around, and eventually relapsed. I quit my job. In the midst of
this instability, I was still asked to serve on NA service projects.
My first thought many mornings was "I can't handle it; I want
to kill myself." But I kept showing up, assuming this was
normal for someone who had lost so much. In meetings, I heard
other NA members share about facing extreme emotional pain
and surviving. I decided I would just ride it out. But it started
getting weird.
  The depression didn't go away. Instead, it got much worse. I
heard voices and saw people who weren't there. I knew I wasn't us-
ing drugs, but I was hallucinating. In less than a year, I went from
living in a six-bedroom house to being homeless. I couldn't even
hold down a menial job. I had to sell blood to get food. I would
spend days sitting in a chair, doing nothing, feeling nothing. At
meetings, I struggled to find words to share what was going on
with me. I was sleeping on NA members'couches and floors.
  Several loving NA members confronted me with the fact that
I "wasn't myself," and insisted that I see a psychiatrist. Recall-
ing my childhood experiences, I recoiled at the idea. When I
wouldn't go, they took me to the hospital. The medical team
said I was severely depressed and schizophrenic, and prescribed
medication. But I refused to take the meds, because I didn't want
a mood-altering drug in me. And besides, hadn't I been "well"
for nine years of recovery? But my heart kept becoming more
distant. That dreaded total emptiness that I had felt when I was

258 Narcotics Anonymous


    beaten down by addiction...it came back. Once again, I felt
    alienated, hopeless, useless, and worthless. And I wasn't using
    drugs.
       Doctor after doctor told me I was mentally ill, the illness was
    disabling, and that it was something I'd have to live with for the
    rest of my life. I felt a deeper sense of defeat than when I first
    admitted I was an addict. What had I done to deserve this? Why
    did God allow this to happen to me? Hadn't I lived the prin-
    ciples? Hadn't I done everything one is supposed to do in NA?
    Aren't good people supposed to have good lives? Even more
    frightening was the uncertainty about the future. With drug ad-
    diction, NA is a proven way up and out of the hell of using. But
    with a mental illness, what kind of "recovery" would there be?
    How could I live the rest of my days...clean...with the many
    losses that result from mental illness? There was no hiding my
    problems, and there were no solutions in sight. I felt that my life
    was utterly ruined. How could I face the fellowship?
       The confusion I felt inside was mirrored by how others re-
    sponded to me. Some told me that I wasn't clean because I was
    taking meds. The same people who intervened to get me psychi-
    atric help later accused me of getting disability benefits dishon-
    estly. Others blamed my mental problems on "too much service
    work" or "never having worked an honest Fourth Step." Many
    men I sponsored decided not to work steps with me anymore.
    Other NA members said I was faking my illness. Fortunately,
    my sponsor was a very loving presence through all of this. Other
    NA members kept encouraging me, reminding me that NA isn't
    just about people, it's about principles. At times, I could feel the
    Higher Power in my life reminding me that I was loved, mental
    illness or not. Despite all the pain, the fellowship buoyed me
    with enough wisdom and caring to help me through this very
    difficult period.
       Some of the most precious wisdom in my recovery is born out
    of my ignorance. Through the initial year or two of living clean

                                                       Regardless of... 259


with a mental illness, I learned a valuable lesson: Mental illness is
an outside issue in NA, but how I deal with it in my personal recovery
is very much an inside issue. Tenth and Eleventh Step journaling
was critical in helping me get a grasp on where my recovery
ended and my mental illness began. I had to make the distinc-
tion in order to stay clean. I learned that struggles with recovery
never put me in the hospital, and that addicts aren't psycholo-
gists or psychiatrists unless they have a PhD after their name.
When I first got clean, I had to learn how to explain addiction
to people who had no experience using drugs, while also learn-
ing how to make sense of my addiction internally. The only way
I could do this was to work the steps and learn what addiction
and recovery really were. Now, I had to explain mental illness
to NA members who had strong misconceptions about it. I had
to rely on the steps to learn about my mental illness and how to
live with it, clean.
   Accepting the losses brought about by mental illness has been
an ongoing challenge. At one point I was in a locked psychiatric
unit, and some NA members were bringing an H&I meeting--
but I wasn't allowed to go, because I wasn't considered stable
enough. The only thing separating me from an NA meeting and
a sixteen-year chip was a locked door. In a very real sense, this
is what it's like to live with a severe illness in recovery: Ongoing
illnesses shut the door on possibilities. But I need to deal with it
with spiritual maturity, so I can enjoy emotional stability.
   I can't compare myself with other NA members. During the
sixteen years I've lived with mental illness, I've never dated,
rarely worked, and sometimes lived in abject poverty. I have
been hospitalized numerous times and have spent days, weeks,
and months emotionally paralyzed and homebound. There have
been long periods of time when the only thing I could do was
go to a meeting, and times when I couldn't go at all. When I'm
in a heavy episode, I can't even pray or meditate. I can work the
steps until I'm blue in the face, and the mental illness won't go

260 Narcotics Anonymous


    away. When I feel that I'm beyond hope, it's difficult to reach out
    to others. But I'm continually reminded that I don't have to walk
    this walk alone.
      Understanding why some days are better than others is like
    knowing why I caught a cold last week instead of this week. In
    recovery from addiction, there are no guarantees, except that I'll
    stay clean when I live clean. When I work the steps, I don't follow
    a plan: I've learned that the plan will fall into place when I keep
    moving forward in recovery. That's why it's important to me to
    keep working the steps--so more can be revealed. The same is
    true with mental illness. Medication isn't a guarantee that I'll
    feel better. Therapy is a good tool, but understanding my illness
    doesn't make it go away. I've learned to apply those tools to the
    mental illness, and NA principles to my addiction.
      In NA's traditions, I'm told that principles come before person-
    alities. But what comes before principles? What gives an addict
    the strength and courage to live by the principles when recov-
    ery doesn't make sense? Why stay clean when it's impossible at
    times to feel the joy of recovery? I believe that the loving God de-
    scribed in Tradition Two that manifests in our group conscience,
    as well as in our service work, our fellowshipping, our work, and
    our play, is the same God that strengthens my personal recovery
    so I can live within the principles. Given the reality that I will face
    severe illness each day, and still being able to stay clean, that's an
    incredible miracle! Spiritually, I'm in a state of grace. I don't al-
    ways feel it, but it's always there. I should have died many times
    over when I was using. Now I live with another disease, equally
    painful, equally life-threatening. I know many people in and out
    of NA who have killed themselves because of mental illness. I'm
    not going to be one of them. It's not an easy path, but I know that
    I'm alive because NA has blessed me with a clean life. Recovery
    makes it possible for me to treasure the moments when I have a
    serene heart, and to be grateful for the miracles, large and small,
    happening all around me.

         As an African American gang member, he didn't think

From Gang Leader to Meeting Leader

I grew   up in South Central Los Angeles. As a child, I had such
severe asthma that I needed shots every other week to keep it
under control. I felt different from the other kids, since I couldn't
run or play without suffering an asthma attack. Fist-fighting
became my way of dealing with the feelings I had about being
different.
  In junior high, my condition got better, but my violent
behavior got worse. The home I was raised in was on the border
between rival street gangs. I was afraid of those guys, but I
wanted them to like me. One day I found a joint on the
playground. I was too afraid to smoke it, so I gave it to an
older guy who was a member of one of the gangs. After that I
was allowed to hang out with them. I learned their walk, their
talk, and their behavior. After I hit my first joint, I really felt a
part of the group. Soon smoking weed was a daily event. One
night I hit what I thought was weed, but it was PCP. I started
experimenting with different drugs.
  Once I was introduced to freebasing cocaine, that was all that
mattered. I am the father of two boys and two girls, but using
cocaine was all that I focused on. I started selling all the things
I had acquired, including my prized custom lowrider. My             19

homies and my family tried to stop me, with no success.
  From the age of thirteen I attended at least one funeral a year,
sometimes two or three. With so much death around me, I always
thought that I would be next, so my behavior was that of some-
one who really didn't think he had a future. As the years passed,

    my drug use and violent activity with the gang increased. I lived
    a life of crime, lowriders, drugs, and violence without really
    knowing that it was a problem.
       In 1990 I was kidnapped by a rival gang, because a deal for
    some guns had gone wrong. The first guy put a gun to my chest
    and squeezed the trigger...it misfired. The driver told them to
    do it outside the car. I was taken out of the car, and started wres-
    tling with the second guy for the gun. He put the gun to the side
    of my head and I heard a pop, felt the heat, and saw a bright
    flash. I saw another flash and felt the heat from a second shot,
    which went into my neck. They left me for dead, but I stumbled
    out of that alley into a grocery store, where someone called for
    help. En route to the hospital I heard the paramedics say that
    they were losing me. This was the first time I actually believed
    in a Higher Power.
       While in the hospital I was told that I had been shot three
    times, twice in the neck and once in the head. The doctors re-
    moved one of the bullets from the back of my head; they left one
    in the back of my neck, and one is still lodged under my tongue.
    I was released from the hospital a month later and went to stay
    with my mother in Atlanta, Georgia.
       I stayed clean on my own for a while, but eventually I started
    using again. I was introduced to the program of Narcotics
    Anonymous, and I shared clean and lived dirty until I couldn't
    anymore. At eleven months clean I relapsed, and suffered
    months of using. I went back into treatment, and I was able to
    accumulate eighteen months clean. I used again, and again lost
    everything that I had obtained--most of all my self-respect.
    They told me: If the drugs don't kill you, the lifestyle will. I had
    to become willing to change my thought process and, more
    importantly, my behavior.
       I joined and became involved with a very loving and power-
    ful home group in Atlanta, where I met my current sponsor, who
    told me that I would need to surrender to win. Surrender up to

that point had been a negative word for me. My thought was if
you surrender, you automatically lose. How can you surrender
and still win? Then it was explained to me that by surrendering
to the program, I would not have to fight anymore. This was
what I was continuously doing: fighting a losing battle. I came
to realize that I could only stay clean if I surrendered to the
program. The members of my home group--in fact, my entire
area--took me under their wing and showed me unconditional
love. I am a firm believer that my Higher Power works through
people, and the people are NA. They have been entrusted to help
me--to not only stay clean but become a better person overall.
  I am currently enjoying eight years of recovery with my wife
and children. I am a successful professional, a student about to
receive a bachelor's degree, and a proud, devoted father, grand-
father, and husband. With my Higher Power and the program of
NA, I am living the life I always wanted. I have learned that this
is a program of progress, not perfection, and I still have major
changes ahead of me. The only way I will be able to obtain the
freedom that so many before me have achieved is first of all not
to use no matter what, to implement the Twelve Steps, and to
help others by carrying the message of hope. Narcotics Anony-
mous made me a promise years ago, and that promise was free-
dom from active addiction. Thank you, Narcotics Anonymous,
for keeping your promise.

          Because she is HIV-positive, this transsexual addict
         was nearly denied surgery. Waiting helped her build
             a stronger relationship with a Higher Power.


Terminally Unique

My    name is..., and I'm just another addict. Sometimes I need to
remind myself of that: I'm just another addict.As a postoperative
transsexual woman, I am not unjustified in feeling unique; there
are fewer than 50,000 of us in the United States. We're a minority
ridiculed and discriminated against by many and often rejected
by our friends and families. It can be a painful existence, and
my disease loves to exploit resentment, fear, self-pity, and self-
loathing.
   Nobody knows why some people are transsexual. In the end
what matters is that I accept myself. Many addicts describe
themselves as feeling like they never fit in, and as a child I felt
this and more. As a teenager I discovered that marijuana cured
my intense shyness and made me feel like I belonged.
   I enlisted in the United States Air Force, and in the military I
partied even harder, a "wild and crazy" guy. I fit in with my party-
down buddies except for one thing: I started cross-dressing--
wearing women's clothing--in secret.
   I didn't know where this compulsion came from, and I tried
resisting the urge. I could sometimes deny it for months, but the
feeling always came back. I felt a deep shame about my secret,
so I used even more to diminish the guilt.
   In 1983 I fell in love with a woman who accepted my past as
long as I was done with it, and I truly believed I was. I proposed
marriage, we moved in together, and I started college.
   School forced me to cut my drug use way back, and my "fe-
tish" returned more strongly than before. I fought it for over a
year, and finally my research at the college library strongly sug-
gested I might be a transsexual woman--a woman trapped in

a man's body--which led to a divorce only fifteen months after
our wedding.
   When I took the first steps to transition to full-time woman-
hood, everybody freaked out. All of my "friends" cut me loose,
my family backed way off, and I received abuse from total
strangers. Even the housecleaning company I worked for would
not permit me to work as a woman. I began to curse God for
making me this way, if there was a God at all.
   Motivated by rebellion as much as poverty, I turned to pros-
titution--at least the people who paid me for sex were nice to
me. Isolated in the sleazy Tenderloin district of San Francisco,
with few real friends and feeling increasingly hopeless, I found
relief in IV drugs. Three months earlier I'd sworn I would never
use a needle. But that was common for my disease; I was always
crossing lines I said I never would.
   I admitted that my life was unmanageable, but I believed it
was the transsexualism making it that way, so I tried going back
to being a man. Shortly thereafter, I found out that I was HIV-
positive. The next two years brought a downward spiral into
increasing addiction, three months in jail, two psychiatric holds,
three rehabs, and a half dozen overdoses, several of which nearly
killed me. In short: jails, institutions, and (almost) death.
   All three rehabs required me to go to NA meetings, where I
heard a message of hope. In 1988, I finally admitted to myself
that I was an addict. Four weeks later I was still clean; not even
jail or basic training had accomplished that.
   When my head was clear I began to feel my feelings again. I
knew I had a problem. At six weeks clean, my most overwhelm-
ing feeling was that I was a woman inside my male body. By ten
weeks I knew for certain that if I did not deal with my transsexu-
ality I would either go back to using or commit suicide.
   I left that rehab homeless, jobless, and penniless, but I had a
clean date, a sponsor, and a home group, and that was enough. I
threw myself into NA, somehow believing everything would be

266 Narcotics Anonymous


    okay. Miracles started happening within two weeks of leaving
    the rehab. Six months later I was living in a drug-free hotel and
    starting a corporate computer programming job. I gritted my
    teeth and presented myself as a guy to get hired, but I believed
    that someday soon I would be able to be myself, a woman, full-
    time. For six months I was a model recovering addict and an
    exemplary employee. I went to meetings daily long past ninety
    days, worked the steps with my sponsor, read all the NA litera-
    ture, and had multiple service commitments. I had an experi-
    enced gender therapist, but I needed my NA program to deal
    sanely with being who I was.
       Just because I was clean and no longer doing sex work didn't
    mean people stopped yelling "freak" and "faggot" at me on the
    street. Nor did my parents suddenly accept me. Some people
    stared at me in meetings. On some days I said the Serenity Prayer
    a dozen times. The closest I came to using that year was when
    I approached my manager with a letter from my therapist and
    explained that I was ready to start living full-time as a woman,
    including at work. Some of the weight lifted when she said that I
    was a good employee and she had no problem with it, but the final
    decision would be up to the divisional vice president.
       My sponsor and my recovering friends said I'd done all I could,
    that I should turn it over to my Higher Power--easier said than
    done. Sure, when I shared in meetings I talked the HP talk with
    the best of them, but I had issues with God. I still hadn't forgiven
    Him or Whomever for making me a transsexual woman, so I had
    little faith. But instead of using, I doubled up on meetings and
    prayed like I actually believed. To my surprise, one month later
    I officially became the newest girl in the office. Just imagine if I'd
    given in to my disease and used!
       After two and a half years of living and working as a woman,
    I grew complacent. I had money, credit, and friends. I'd forgotten
    the pathetic junkie that I'd been. I was deeply in love with a woman
    and living with her. I didn't have much time for meetings. I was

                                                       Regardless of... 267


sick of people staring at me, anyway. I even distanced myself
from my sponsor, so I was completely set up for a fall. All of this
time I'd been saving my money for the surgery that would make
me anatomically female. My therapist agreed I was ready, but I
was devastated to learn that none of the reputable sex change sur-
geons would consider me because of my HIV infection.
   All of my fear, resentment, and self-pity came bubbling to the
surface, but instead of going to my sponsor and meetings, I took
solace in my girlfriend.
   When that relationship became dysfunctional, I went straight
into addict mode, using just six days after I took my four-year
cake. I briefly came back to NA but relapsed again. I spent three
and a half years forgetting that alcohol is a drug. I finally re-
turned to the program, driven by liver disease that turned out
to be hepatitis C. I started the steps again, but dug in my heels
at Step Three. God was the one who put me in this male body
where I would be forever trapped because of a deadly virus.
Perhaps the new HIV medications could keep me alive, but so
what? I'd be a freak for the rest of my life. I didn't want anything
to do with God.
   For two years all I did was go to meetings, but eventually I
got away from even doing that. At three and a half years clean
I found myself diving into deep depressions. Sudden rage was
always close to the surface; I treated myself badly. I didn't want
to use, though. I wanted to kill myself. Instead, I got a new spon-
sor, went back to Step One, and attended ninety meetings in
ninety days. This time I worked the steps like I never had before.
I studied the literature as if I were preparing for final exams.
I wrote an essay on each step. I spent weeks on an exhaustive
Fourth Step, and took an entire afternoon doing Five with my
sponsor. I didn't hesitate when it came to Eight and Nine, either.
I even made amends to people who'd screwed me over big time,
because this was my spiritual housecleaning, not theirs. Within a
year I'd completed all the steps as thoroughly as I could.

268 Narcotics Anonymous


       Over that year I noticed subtle changes. I wasn't so quick to
    anger, and I was much kinder to myself. Most of all, I no longer
    lived in perpetual fear or self-pity. My spiritual awakening came
    not in a flash of light, but slowly, over time. The first big test
    came at my fourth NA birthday, when the company I'd worked
    at for twelve years had massive layoffs. For some reason I didn't
    panic like I used to. Instead, I took a deep breath and looked for
    a new position in the corporation. Out of the blue I was offered a
    better position. The miracle of that ordeal was not the last-minute
    job offer but the calm response so unusual for me. It was the first
    sign of my growing faith.
       The reason I now have an unshakable faith may seem strange,
    but it was my most powerful moment of spiritual awakening. In
    2001 I learned of a gifted surgeon who could make me physically
    complete as a woman, despite my HIV. The catch was that my
    immune system had to hold steady. My T-cell count, the primary
    indicator of my health, has always fluctuated, and I tearfully
    confessed my worries to my sponsor. She told me I had to turn
    it over to my Higher Power, reminding me, "If you're supposed
    to have this surgery, then you'll have it." As my eyes filled with
    helpless tears, she gently asked me, "Who's in charge?"
       It was what I wanted least and needed most to hear. By the
    time I hit my knees for my nightly prayer, I had turned it over. I
    slept like a baby that night. Afew days before my surgery I had a
    stunning realization: My Higher Power had always known what
    was best for me. When I didn't get my way about whatever it was
    that I wanted, I'd never before stopped to consider that perhaps
    things happened for a reason.
       I finally understand that I was denied this surgery in 1992
    because I wasn't ready for it. I skimped on my recovery and
    mouthed platitudes about God, but I was nearly as fearful and
    self-centered as when I had a needle in my arm. I didn't really
    trust my Higher Power, and I could not have handled this roller-
    coaster ride. I thought I was ready, but God knew otherwise. It

was actually a blessing that I was forced to wait. I just hope this
profound lesson carries to the next time I don't get what I want
when I want it.
  I write this coming up on my ninth NA birthday, grateful my
hepatitis is in remission, and I am nearly three years off nicotine.
Aside from being clean, the greatest gift is true faith in my Higher
Power, whom I choose to call Goddess. Faith helped me get past
the disease that used to rule me. Whenever I catch myself drift-
ing back into my defects, I just remember that Goddess is in
charge. All I need to do is live the principles of the program to
the best of my ability, and She will take care of the rest.

     This Iroquois descendant ended up in an institution for "hard
     cases." When NA members brought a meeting in and shared,
        it was like seeing himself in the mirror for the first time.

A Textbook Case

I am an addict. In Narcotics Anonymous, I have learned what
that means: who we are, what we share in common, where our
nature leads us, and how together we recover.
   My family descends from Canyenkehaka, the Iroquois people
Europeans call Mohawks. I was taught that within all creatures
dwells a soul which desires only peace and comfort, by the
warming fire of the heart. The soul is the keeper of the spirit,
which yearns to fly beyond the body and mind. We may be one
with the Great Spirit only when our souls let go, setting our spir-
its free. This concept of spirituality makes sense to me. However,
my soul is dark. Anything I let go of is covered with claw marks.
Spiritual recovery began for me when I discovered Narcotics
Anonymous and started working the Twelve Steps and living
the NA way.
   Early on I lost the simple faith I was born with. Oversensitive
and exposed without it, I turned in on myself. My belief is that my
soul took my spirit hostage out of fear and locked it away. I became
a remote child living in a world of dreams. Perhaps I was always an
addict. I attributed magical qualities to people, places, and things,
as if a cure for my emptiness lay with them. Other troubled kids,
secret hideouts, and toys at first--and lovers, hangouts, and drugs
later--all became objects of obsession for me.
   When I was seven years old I broke my leg pretty badly. I
learned about unbearable pain and the horror and terror that at-
tend it, and the ability of a chemical to relieve me of pain and fear.
It was miraculous. Just like that, my problems disappeared. My
bones were still broken. What mattered was that I didn't feel it.

   Three things characterized my drug use from the start. First,
I knew it was wrong, which made it more attractive. Second,
I used to remove distress, whether physical, emotional, or
psychic--generally rendering myself unconscious in the effort.
And third, no consequences could dissuade me from using.
   I took bizarre risks. By the time I was fourteen I had broken
both arms, both legs, and a front tooth, and was rewarded with
painkillers every time. I got into trouble with the authorities,
and when I was old enough, got arrested. I was angry and self-
righteous. My drug use steadily advanced. I was addicted to all
kinds of things: to chemicals, sex, relationships, gambling, theft,
and escapism in whatever form; to risk-taking, rule-breaking,
overeating, overspending, overindulging, even to the chaos of
my daily life. I was enslaved to impulsive thinking and compul-
sive behavior. I tried for a dozen years to quit, but nothing ever
worked.
   I ended up in an institution for hard cases, from criminals to
psychotics. We all ate together in a big dining hall. My first day
there I got stabbed with a fork when I sat in a chair occupied by a
woman's imaginary friend. I remember looking around at all the
other lost souls--hallucinating schizoids, catatonics, wet-brained
lifers sulking in silent remorse, wrist-slashing teens who snorted
saccharine off the tables--and I realized I belonged. The sum of
all my resources and experience had landed me here. This was
my family now. I realized the true extent of my illness, but I had
no inkling of what ailed me.
   One day several people from outside the facility came to
speak. They introduced themselves as addicts, members of Nar-
cotics Anonymous. They read from a little white book, and what
I could grasp made sense to me. One of them told her story. She
spoke of feelings that I had always had but never heard put into
words. Then other people talked. I identified with their struggles
and recognized the despair they'd felt. Yet they were full of hope
and humor, which I found suspect. I decided that they were

272 Narcotics Anonymous


    preaching some cult of temperance. Still, what I heard struck a
    chord. I showed up to hear more when they came back around.
      When I was released I asked for Narcotics Anonymous meet-
    ings in my area. I listened as people shared their experience.
    Some had been through much tougher times than me. Others
    spoke of extended "clean time" or "coming back" from a relapse,
    both of which gave me hope. What fascinated me was the ability
    of NA members to express their feelings, good and bad. At one
    meeting this guy ran his hand down the center of his chest, say-
    ing, "This is the Grand Canyon." Another time a woman pointed
    at her head and called it "a thousand clowns on a carousel." An-
    other spoke tearfully about a recent relapse and said, "I know
    I have a disease of shame, but this feels like shame times ten."
    That struck me like a sledgehammer. Clearly, this was where I
    needed to be.
      While making meetings and learning about the nature of ad-
    diction, I was still hanging out with old friends in old places.
    After six weeks, I picked up. But now no amount of drugs could
    suppress the revulsion I felt about what I was doing. I fell back
    to old thinking and behavior, which divested me of any sense of
    humanity. Those were the worst ten months of my life.
      During that run, I internalized what I had heard at NA meet-
    ings. It was true about the progressive nature of my illness.
    Staying clean for a time hadn't cured me. It was true about the
    involuntary nature of my destructiveness, my complete inability
    to control myself through willpower. I could see things that had
    brought about my relapse. Instead of sticking with people in
    the fellowship, I had run back to my using buddies. I had never
    worked the steps or taken a sponsor. The first time I read the
    Twelve Steps, I realized they were the most radical principles
    I had ever come across. But I couldn't be bothered with all that
    "spiritual nonsense."
      The day came when I couldn't go on. I was sick of myself and
    felt nothing but anger, disgust, and shame. When I went to an

NAmeeting, sat down in the front, and cried, I came in out of the
cold for the last time.
  I'd come to believe that the group was a power greater than
myself which could restore me to sanity. With that hope, I started
taking suggestions. I reached out for a sponsor to lead me
through the steps. I made a decision to turn my life over to a lov-
ing Spirit which I could pray to. I asked in humble sincerity for
relief from my self-destructiveness. My urge to use was lifted. It
has never returned.

I work steps. Our steps work miracles in my life every time I

and what that requires of me. I learned that I am a "textbook
case"--which is good, since we have a textbook solution in our
Basic Text. I have learned to live on life's terms, to be grateful for
Nature's blessings. And I pray daily to the Higher Power I was
reunited with in NA: "Great Spirit, let my soul be at peace, my
spirit free, and my mind untroubled and clean."

      The process of recovery and the spiritual principles of NA
        are a power greater than himself for this atheist addict.

Atheists Recover Too

I grew  up without a teaching of god. My father, though raised
in a very devout family, renounced all faith in the religion he
had been taught. I too couldn't believe that there was something
out there that had some magical power to do the impossible--to
defy the laws of physics. There were many things beyond my
understanding, but to attribute them to a deity was, in my mind,
just another way of avoiding the fear of the unknown. Too many
people used god, or the devil, as it were, to deflect credit due or
to avoid taking responsibility for their mistakes. I viewed the in-
stitution of religion as a means of controlling the masses, and I
didn't want to be controlled.
   I made it my mission to refute this god in which other people
believed and put their faith, but they resisted. In fact, in spite of
all my efforts, I convinced not one person that they were wrong
and that I was right. I just isolated myself all the more.
   So, when I got clean I was apprehensive, to say the least. How-
ever, I was ready for a new way of life, so I just focused on today,
and just for today I was on Step One. And there was no god in
Step One. I got a sponsor who taught me about showing up and
being dependable. He taught me about how to be available and
not to be judgmental. He shared his experience and allowed me
mine. The foundation of my recovery was laid in our relation-
ship. I wanted what he had and was beginning to get it.
   We moved on to Step Two, and it was time to cross the god
bridge. I went on a quest to find a power greater than myself. I
stepped out of my comfort zone and sought out people of both
conventional and unconventional religious faiths. I opened my
mind to what worked for others. I questioned, I listened, and I
practiced. My search brought me to a number of different spiritual


                                 274

and religious groups, but I didn't find my place among any
of them. What I was looking for was something quantifiable,
something tangible to put on display--"See this? This is what I
believe. This is the god of my understanding." Maybe if I could
find that god, recovery would be easier. But that's not what I
found.
  With no breakthroughs, feeling lost and dejected, I decided to
approach Step Two another way. Perhaps the steps, the fellow-
ship, service, and my sponsor would be enough to help me find
recovery, without a god.
  Steps Three, Seven, and Eleven posed the greatest challenge
because of their references to god and prayer. Steps Two and Six
required some creative thinking as well. In practicing the Sec-
ond Step, NA and the group became a power greater than me.
By participating and being of service I was able to put the needs
of the group and the suffering addict before my wants. My self-
centeredness began to ease, and a restoration to sanity began to
take place. I was right where I was supposed to be. I could see
that my struggles weren't in vain, even when times were hard. I
was experiencing life and growing as a result.
  In the Third Step, I began turning my will and my life over to
the process of recovery and to the spiritual principles that could
be found in the steps. I was told to be honest about my belief,
even if it was devoid of a god; otherwise the remaining steps
would be of no value. I started to have faith in what recovery
could offer me. With the strength and courage I found, I contin-
ued with the rest of the steps.
  In Step Six, my defects of character were in the forefront of my
mind. As I became more aware of their effects on my life, I tried
to control my defects by suppressing them. The result was that
they seemed to become worse, causing more harm, both to those
close to me and to myself. I reached the place where I was entire-
ly ready to be rid of my defects, and I moved on to Step Seven.

      Believing that humility was an important aspect of the Sev-
    enth Step, I went to others for their experience. By earnestly
    seeking the experience of others, including those with whom
    I had little in common, I was performing acts of humility. I en-
    deavored to live life by spiritual principles in order to relieve my
    shortcomings. Instead of merely trying to be rid of my shortcom-
    ings, I sought to replace them with something positive.
      Step Eleven was a bit of a conundrum. "I'm an atheist who be-
    lieves in the power of prayer," I became known for saying. The
    statement, meant to shock people, became a conviction. Prayer
    wasn't getting on my knees and petitioning a deity. Rather, it was
    how I lived. As a prayer, all my decisions became important and
    relevant, regardless of how insignificant they might seem on the
    surface. I saw meditation as a tool or exercise to help expand my
    awareness. It helped to put me in the moment and to maintain
    my presence of mind throughout the day.
      The result was a spiritual awakening, a realization that I could
    stay clean, work the steps, be an upstanding member of Narcot-
    ics Anonymous, have a life worth living, and carry a message of
    recovery. All this was possible without a god. My initial fear of
    not being able to stay clean because I could not "come to believe"
    in a god had passed. I now had proof that it was possible, and the
    proof was in how I lived.
      I have sponsored many people, some who struggle with be-
    lieving in god and others who have a firm religious faith. Those
    who struggle find that they are not alone and are accepted as
    they are. Those with strong faith find that they too can share
    openly with me, and their beliefs are welcomed and accepted.
    Either way, my sponsees and I have the opportunity to grow
    together. I trust that what they come to believe has the power
    to help them, and they have the same trust in what I have come
    to believe. Sometimes we disagree on the particulars, but the
    particulars aren't what keep us clean. What keeps us clean is the
    choice that each of us makes not to pick up and to live this way
    of life to the best of our ability.

   This is a spiritual program, not a religious one. I try different
approaches to working the steps. I still read and try to expand
my knowledge on spiritual topics, and I constantly review my
experience and contemplate its meaning in my life. This isn't to
say that I don't question what I believe from time to time, or that
I don't struggle, because I do. Life isn't always easy. Sometimes
I feel alone during hard times. Believing in a god is alluring, be-
cause I know others find comfort there, but I do not. Today I do
have a spiritual solution, however. The steps provide me with
a framework for applying spiritual principles. Service acts as a
conduit to relieve my self-centered thinking. The fellowship re-
minds me that I'm not alone, and my sponsor is a guide through
the process. I continue to be a seeker. Anyone with a desire to
stay clean can stay clean.

           She got clean with her husband of twenty years,
      and eight years later nursed him through terminal cancer
         while both of her parents were terminally ill. Now,
          at sixty-one, she shares that the program can help
             any of us, regardless of age or circumstance.


Never Alone

I am sixty-one years old and have been clean for fifteen years.
My husband and I got clean at the same time. He was fifty-two
at the time and I was forty-six. We had children older than most
of the people in our meetings. NA seemed to us to be a bunch of
young kids. I didn't think we could relate.
  Even though we were the oldest people we saw at meetings,
we stayed and heard the message of recovery in NA: that any
addict can live clean and lose the desire to use. We went to a
meeting every evening. Sitting in the rooms day after day with
the same bunch of kids, we heard them telling our own stories.
We heard people talking about the feeling of despair their addic-
tion had led them to and the pain of trying to quit and not being
able to. Hearing these stories, we knew that regardless of age,
the pain of addiction was the same for everyone, and this was
where we belonged. Eventually, we even met a few other folks
our age.
  I had been using since I was a small child when I'd raid my
mother's medicine cabinet. In high school my best friend's fa-
ther was an anesthesiologist. We would use the Physicians' Desk
Reference like a catalog to decide what to take. Around this time,
another friend turned me on to pot. She said, "Smoke this." I
wanted to be as cool as she was, so I did. For the next thirty-three
years I chased drugs from coast to coast and made them the cen-
ter of my existence.
  In the late 1960s and early 1970s it seemed that all of America
had discovered drugs. I felt like I was in the vanguard of culture.

                                  278

But when the rest of the country seemed to stop using, I didn't.
When I finally wanted to, I couldn't.
  Finally, at some point in the late 1980s, my husband became
depressed. Imagine that! You fill your body with depressants
and wonder why you're depressed. He went to treatment for
his addiction and was introduced to NA there. He moved into
a boarding house and went to meetings and tried to stay clean
even though he was still buying drugs for me. He lasted three
months that way, and then relapsed and went on a three-year
run.
  Meanwhile, I was using more than ever. I was strung out on
something I didn't even like. Eventually the day came when I
realized I couldn't give up the drugs, so I gave up on life. I knew
there were people who didn't use drugs, and clearly their lives
were better than the lives of anyone I knew who did use, cer-
tainly better than my life. But it never occurred to me that I could
change, that I could be a different person, one who didn't use.
I didn't want to do this anymore, and I couldn't see any way to
stop. So I bought a huge piece and did it all. And God stepped
into my life.
  Even though it was the middle of the day in the middle of the
week, my son stopped over at my house. To this day he doesn't
know why he dropped by. He found me passed out but still alive
and called an ambulance. This had not been a cry for help like I'd
done in times past. This time I was seriously trying to die. I woke
up in the hospital in five-point restraints.
  I was given a choice between a ten-day voluntary commitment
and an indefinite involuntary commitment. I chose to go volun-
tarily. The big surprise was the sense of relief I felt. I didn't have
to pretend that I was okay. I didn't have to struggle to keep it to-
gether anymore. I needed help, and I was going to get it.
  My husband had been to NA before, so he knew what to do.
He would come to the hospital, pick me up on a pass, and take
me to a meeting. Then he'd drop me off back at the hospital, go

280 Narcotics Anonymous


    home, and get loaded. When the ten days were up and I was
    ready to come home, he realized that he would have to stay clean
    if I were to stay clean. So we both went to a meeting. It was his
    first day, and I had ten days more.
       For the first year, we went to a meeting every day--sometimes
    two or three. We got sponsors, worked the steps, and did all of
    our socializing in NA. We had service positions. We got a home
    group. We made friends. We realized that the age difference
    was irrelevant because our feelings were the same as everyone
    else's.
       It was hard at first doing the step work. Steps One, Two, and
    Three weren't too hard because the powerlessness and unman-
    ageability were self-evident. I knew that I was alive because of a
    Higher Power. But Step Four was a different matter. How was I
    supposed to write about forty-six years of resentments and bad
    behavior? I had no idea whom I had hurt, ripped off, or dam-
    aged. I figured it was pretty much everyone I'd ever been near.
    I was guided by a more experienced member who told me my
    Higher Power would reveal what I needed to see at that time. I'd
    get to do the steps again, and more things would come up then.
    That made it possible for me to move on.
       When I was in the middle of my Eighth Step I was invited to
    visit my family for a week. They lived 3,000 miles away from my
    home. I quickly went over my Ninth Step work with my sponsor
    so that I would be able to make amends to my mother, stepfather,
    brother, and sister-in-law all in one week. They all said the only
    amends I could make for them was to stay clean.
       Life got good. I went to school and got a bachelor's and then a
    graduate degree. I started my own psychotherapy practice. My
    father even said he was proud of me, something he'd never said
    before in my life.
       When I had six years clean, a friend with more experience in
    NAdied of cancer. The fellowship gathered around him and sup-
    ported him through his illness. In addition to the home health

care provider, two addicts were with him at all times. One of his
sponsees moved in and slept there. He talked about his experi-
ence as he was dying; he said he was growing from a thorn into
a rose. He died clean, with great dignity and strength. He had
taught us how to live clean, and he taught us how to die clean.
  Two years later my husband was diagnosed with cancer. My
father was dying of cancer, and my mother was ill with heart
disease. Getting clean gives us the opportunity to deal with the
conditions of our lives, whether we like them or not, in a way
that we can feel good about. It doesn't matter what happens; it
matters how I react when it happens. Losing my husband or my
son was the only reservation in my First Step.
  I went to meetings and talked about my reservations. I was
afraid I wouldn't be able to stay clean without my husband. I
wasn't sure I wanted to stay alive without him. We had been
together for twenty-eight years, raised children together, trav-
eled together, cared for one another through the worst years of
our addiction, and gotten clean together. Since we had gotten
clean, our relationship had deepened and flowered into one of
deep mutual respect and unconditional love. He was my heart. I
couldn't imagine life without him.
  My husband was ill for six months. During that time we trav-
eled to Mexico and to Hawaii. We went to the world convention
in San Jose. It was there that I first learned how to reach out and
ask for help. The people in the program were wonderful during
his illness. His sponsees, my sponsor and sponsees, and friends
from the fellowship all called often and came frequently to visit.
One of my sponsees is a nurse. She wasn't working at the time, so
she would come on a moment's notice to relieve me if I needed to
go out. Loving, caring people surrounded us all of the time. Our
hospice social worker, who had nursed another NAfriend, told us
that NA was the best support system he had ever seen.
  I wasn't able to see my father before he died, because he died
only eleven days before my husband. My mother died eighteen

    months after that. I was terrified that now I would be alone. I
    thought the pain of all that loss would turn my heart to ice. I
    thought I would suffocate because I couldn't breathe. The only
    thing I could think to do was to go to a meeting. I talked about
    my pain. I continued to talk about it until I thought people were
    running away when they saw me coming. I reached out to my
    Higher Power. I stayed on an Eleventh Step for the next several
    years. I came to know and to trust my Higher Power, whose only
    wish for me is that I use the opportunities life provides me with
    to heal and grow.
      It was, and remains, very difficult. But I have not had to use.
    I've stayed connected to my program. I go to three to six meet-
    ings every week, even now. I have a sponsor. I work the steps.
    I sponsor many women. I do service, and I read the literature.
    I have a spiritual community and my faith, trust, and relation-
    ship with God have deepened and grown strong. I have good
    days and bad days. I still have so much to learn about how to
    live clean. When it gets tough, I go to a meeting or call a friend
    or work with a sponsee or help someone else or pray and pray
    and pray. I work Step Twelve by trying to practice the spiritual
    principles I have learned in NA in all of my affairs, both within
    and outside the rooms.
      My life is full. I am so grateful to NA for taking a wounded,
    sick little girl of forty-six and teaching her how to live--clean.

         The youngest person in the room, this addict still felt
        a connection right away and over time came to realize
      that recovery from addiction is a bond that transcends age.

Regardless of Age

The   first NA member I ever spoke to was the same age as my
mother. I have been clean since the summer after my freshman
year of high school. I'd been using drugs for just a few months.
                      20

Those were the worst months of my life. In that short amount
of time I had been placed in police custody, expelled from high
school, and forced by my parents to check into a rehab. I knew
I had a problem and I knew I needed help. The first time I had
heard of Narcotics Anonymous was when I saw it listed on a
brochure from my rehab. I didn't have a whole lot of options, so
I decided to give it a shot. The first thing I noticed about NA was
that everyone was much older than me. It was rare to see anyone
within ten years of my age. These people were getting high be-
fore I was even born. When I was in kindergarten playing with
blocks, they were dealing drugs, getting arrested, and living in
the depths of active addiction. What could I possibly have in
common with these old guys?
  This question was answered before the meeting even started
when an NA member who could easily have been my mother
asked me if I was an addict. It was the first time anyone had
asked me that and I didn't know what to say. I didn't need to say
anything. I felt something. There was a connection between the
two of us that transcended age. I could feel it in her voice, in her
eyes, and in her spirit. There was something there that I hadn't
felt before and I wanted to feel again.
  I sat in the very back of the room. I don't remember anything
that was shared at that meeting, but I remember hearing in the
readings that "anyone may join us regardless of age." That was

20"Freshman" year is the first year of high school.

                                    283

284 Narcotics Anonymous


    all I needed to hear. I was so desperate to fit in somewhere and
    belong to something that I just clung to those words and kept
    coming back. The more I listened to people sharing, the less I
    thought of their age. When I socialized with members after a
    meeting and went out for dinner, they ceased to be "older peo-
    ple" and became my friends. When I would tell them how I felt,
    they responded with a recognition that I could never get from
    nonaddicts my own age.
       I am now in my third year of college and am living quite a
    peculiar life for a college student. On Friday nights when most
    of my classmates are out partying with drugs, I go to my home
    group of NA. I share about how I'm feeling, what I need to work
    on, and how I think I can get better. I go out after the meeting
    with other addicts who are over twice my age. I am still most
    often the youngest person at many meetings. It is a rare and pre-
    cious gift to have the opportunity to get clean early in life. Re-
    covery is a lifelong process, and I am grateful to have my whole
    life ahead of me. I need all the time I can get. When I see young
    people walk into a meeting, I try to carry the message that re-
    covery is possible at any age. It can be tempting to think that I'm
    not sick enough for recovery. I didn't use hard enough drugs. My
    bottom wasn't low enough. As my sponsor told me, your bottom
    is wherever you choose to stop digging. Membership doesn't de-
    pend on extensive previous experience.
       I try to give back to the younger members of NA. When I carry
    the NA message into juvenile treatment centers, I feel deeply
    grateful that I have been given a message that I now have the op-
    portunity to give back. When I reach out and talk to young new-
    comers, I am reminded of where I started out and how far I've
    grown in recovery. Afew years ago I got the opportunity to speak
    at a workshop called "Youth in Recovery" at my regional conven-
    tion. I took this service commitment in a genuine spirit of humili-
    ty.As I looked out at the crowd full of teenagers and young adults,
    I felt the presence of my higher power. I had never seen so many

                                                     Regardless of... 285


young addicts before. The room looked like a college lecture hall.
Here were all these addicts just like me. I realized that I'm not
so different after all. After the meeting, a teenager told me that I
had shared his story. I can't begin to count how many times I've
sat at meetings and thought the speaker was sharing my story,
whether they were around my age or much older. I know that
there will always be people with whom I can relate, on the level
of specific experiences and on the spiritual level.
  It's an odd thing when older members tell me that I'm so lucky
to get clean so young. Yes, I am very lucky, and so is every other
member of Narcotics Anonymous. I prefer to think of myself as
a part of a fellowship full of fortunate souls, rather than some
kind of exceptionally lucky individual. I can get off track when
I start thinking of myself as different from other NA members.
The bottom line is that anyone may join us and feel just as much
a part of the program as anyone else.
  I'll always remember the time I was in a meeting with only
one other member. There was a terrible blizzard out, but I
happened to live very close to the meeting so I walked there
anyway. The only other person there was fifty years older than
me. I hadn't even entered the workforce yet, and he was already
retired. I had heard him share before about feeling different
because everyone else was so much younger than him. That
night, we shared about our lives and our experiences. The
details were different but the feelings and the spirit were the
same. The point couldn't have been made clearer to me. We are a
fellowship with a diverse range of experiences and one common
identity: recovering addicts.

     As a PhD student in pharmacology, his knowledge of drugs

The   squawking voice on the police radio blared a description of
me to the authorities. I ran into the freezing morning and began a
zigzag trip to my apartment. I turned my jacket inside out so the
color would be different. I was crawling through people's back-
yards in a Midwestern college town, an emaciated, drug-addled
junior Rambo. I anxiously asked neighbors if they had seen any
police around, my eyes bugging in panic, jacket inside out, sleep-
less for days. With their nervous assurance that they hadn't seen
anyone, I went inside, threw away my stash, and crashed into a
deep sleep, despite the looming raid.
  That I heard the "police broadcast" in a bathroom of a deserted
university building at 4:00 am on the day before Thanksgiving
didn't cross my mind. The delusion of my imminent arrest felt
absolutely real, and it fueled my panicked and pathetic reaction.
I had been mainlining a relative of methamphetamine for three
days without sleep, and the overdose had caused temporary
psychosis.
  I found this particular drug in the pharmacology department
where I was a PhD student. It was the latest substance obtained
                              21

from my continuous foraging. My studies had become a hol-
low cover story; the search for drugs was my main activity. This
went on around fellow students, staff, and professors who were
growing increasingly concerned with my strange behavior and
worsening appearance. As awareness grew that substances were
walking out of laboratories, security measures kept improving.
The foraging got harder and my standards got lower, while my

21"Pharmacology" is the science of drug action.

appetite for drugs kept increasing. I wouldn't call chemically
induced paranoid schizophrenia a quality high, but I was way
past the point where using had the remotest connection to recre-
ation. Drugs had become the center of my life.
   "The Night of the Police Raid" is just one story from the bot-
tom I experienced before I could seek help. The consequences of
my using--getting evicted by a girlfriend who had finally given
up; my gray complexion; my arms and legs covered with needle
marks; the complete decay of my routine; the channeling of all
my energy, resources, and creativity to find drugs; endangering
the careers and reputations of my colleagues--made it clear even
to me that I had a problem with drugs. Near the end, I admit-
ted that death by an overdose would provide an out. That was
where addiction had taken me. All I had was fear and the need
to take drugs at any cost. My key delusion was that my problem
only involved me; either I could solve it, or no one could. Isola-
tion paves the road to active addiction, and it nearly killed me.
   My actions did finally bring about a solution, but not the one
I imagined. In a bathroom stall I injected one drug to counteract
the effects of another. I collapsed, waking to find two freaked-out
custodians thinking I was dead. I was put in the hospital, and
kicked out of the PhD program with the warning that if I en-
tered the building, the police would be called. My science career
ended, and my recovery began.
   Getting kicked out of graduate school was the best thing that
ever happened to me. No, I didn't suddenly stop using; I wasn't
done yet. But something had changed. That loss, together with
all the others, made me admit that perhaps I couldn't manage
my problem. I had a sense that maybe things could be different,
but I still didn't know anything about living clean. That was for
other people to show me.
   The disease of addiction cuts across all social and economic
boundaries. When people have this illness, drugs will find them.
The routes can vary enormously, but the destination is always

    the same. I didn't grow up in an abusive family. I lived in an
    affluent town and was educated in an excellent public school
    system. I had a comfortable home and a family that was lov-
    ing but perplexed by my self-destructive behavior. I had talent,
    health, opportunities, friends, and material support by any mea-
    sure. But I am different from normal people; I am hard-wired for
    addiction. I can see now that some of my earliest thoughts and
    behaviors gave hints of what was to come.
      I found ways to get high, the usual things that people do in
    school. But for me these experiences felt important. I vividly re-
    member the first time I got drunk, the first time I used each of
    a long list of drugs. My using seemed controlled, but I got high
    every day of high school, and whatever drugs were around were
    part of the mix. In college I regularly did outlandish, selfish, and
    dangerous things to get high. I loved being a student and learn-
    ing, but the parallel life of constant using was always there.
      The addict inside me is incredibly resourceful at finding and
    using drugs. When it was time for graduate school, I really did
    find pharmacology fascinating. But that choice also made drugs
    accessible to someone with no "street smarts." In the years that
    followed, a lethal process operated alongside my legitimate in-
    terests. Eventually, as goals got in the way of using, they fell by
    the wayside. The progression of my disease could be gauged by
    a series of bargains I made and broke with myself to manage my
    using. "I'll never use during the week" fell to "I'll never use dur-
    ing the day" fell to "I'll never inject drugs" fell to "I'll never let
    this hurt my career" fell to drugs becoming my career. My aca-
    demic expertise about drugs was a dangerous hindrance to my
    recovery. I was convinced my knowledge of drugs would make
    them more manageable. I now realize that this is like a ballistics
    expert thinking he is bullet-proof. My arrogance and delusion
    would be funny if they hadn't come so close to doing me in.
      My recovery started with the undeserved kindness of one of
    the many professors I had screwed over while using. In an act

of pure generosity, he found a drug counselor who would not
be fooled by my tendency to manipulate people with my edu-
cation. In my first sessions with him, I looked terrible, sounded
crazy, and thought I had it totally together. But somewhere in
my deluded brain was the desire to change. That counselor was
the first person I had ever met who called himself an addict and
had figured out how to live without drugs. That was intriguing;
I wanted to know more. He first earned my trust, and then after
a few weeks he sprang the trap: "If you want to keep coming
here, then you have to do something else." More tests? Read-
ing assignments? Visits to medical doctors? No. "If you want to
keep coming to me, you also have to start going to meetings."
Although I was skeptical and afraid, I decided I'd better go. A

addict!
  I went in with my "difference radar" turned way up, finding
all sorts of ways I was distinct from those people, not part of that
crowd. I was arrogant and judgmental, looking at the superfi-
cial differences instead of the underlying similarities. However,
there was one difference that surprised me. I had figured the
steps would be some sort of instruction set about not using--
"Step One: We don't take opiates. Step Two: We don't inject any-
thing...." But when I heard the Twelve Steps read out loud, they
didn't even mention drugs! Here was a room full of people who
were keeping clean using a set of ideas that had never crossed
my mind. Since my ideas about keeping clean had failed miser-
ably, I found hope in the fact that these people were doing some-
thing different, and getting different results.
  Some people experience recovery like a lightning bolt: a sud-
den flash of understanding and clarity, an immediate lifting of
the desire to use. The effect of the program on me was more like
rain or wind, gradually eroding my false beliefs. It is a process
that continues each day I stay clean. I gradually learned that I
have an incurable, lethal disease, that having it is not my fault,

    but that seeking recovery is my responsibility. I slowly came to
    understand that fellowship is toxic to addiction, and that isola-
    tion is a prerequisite for relapse. I still need to be reminded that
    my best information about recovery is heard from others, and
    not my own loud head. I still struggle with the truth that in re-
    covery, good action often comes before full understanding; it
    makes the scientist in me bristle. Some days I learn something
    new, and others I feel like I am making no progress at all. But so
    long as I stay clean, the slow pace of my recovery is not a prob-
    lem. There's no end to the process, so there's no need to hurry.
      The life I have is the unlikely gift of recovery. I am a profes-
    sor at a large university. My colleagues are incredibly bright,
    creative, and energetic; I am humbled to work with them, and
    honored by their trust and respect. I have long-lasting friend-
    ships in and out of NA, a healthy relationship with my family,
    and the luxury of earning a living doing what I love and respect.
    I am truly blessed, and it all springs from living the NA way.
    That doesn't mean my life is perfect. I have problems, fears, frus-
    trations, and a constant struggle with low self-esteem. But I can
    imagine where I would be had I not gotten clean. I recall a high
    school acquaintance named Mike. We had very similar paths. We
    both were interested in science, both ended up in pharmacology
    departments, both used heavily, both thought our knowledge
    would protect us. But Mike died from an overdose over twenty
    years ago. My life is a gift, no matter what the day's details in-
    volve, and I owe that to recovery.
      "You can have anything you want, so long as you're willing to
    pay for it." This is an NA "chestnut" we often hear in the rooms.
    For me, this is not only about what I might want, but also about
    what I have already received. My sponsor told me that every
    day I have clean is a debt owed to NA, so I am willing to pay for
    the recovery I have today. The price of my continued growth in
    recovery is offering the same gift to others. When I didn't have
    the experience to know about this path, others, both addicts

and nonaddicts, helped me find the way. They were doing my
Higher Power's work, and now it is my turn to do the same by
participating in the recovery of others. When I think about things
this way, it is clear to me why fellowship is the foundation of
recovery.
  Even with over twenty years clean, I still have to fight the
urge to distance myself from people at meetings by focusing on
differences. But now I know this is just my disease showing its
discomfort with NA. I always try to look for the similarities be-
tween me and my fellow addicts. But that doesn't mean we are
all the same. In NA, unity is not uniformity, and there is no better
example of this than how different addicts can be. NA is a big
enough house for every sort of person. We can speak any lan-
guage, have any politics or ideas about our Higher Power, and
come from any upbringing. In this diverse and growing group of
people there is someone for everyone, as a sponsor, a confidant,
or a trusting newcomer. It is our diversity that makes recovery
possible for anyone. No addict ever needs to feel that they don't
belong, whether they know the ivory tower or the guard tower.

     When NA first started in Japan, even members didn't believe
   a normal life could be possible for addicts, and especially women,
       in recovery. As the fellowship matured, this member and
           others like her came to realize "there is no model
                       of the recovering addict."


What Makes Me Happy Now

It took me about ten years to realize I could be an NA member
and live a normal life. Before I got clean, it seemed that there
were hardly any women in Japan who were addicted to drugs. I
seemed to be alone. No one in my family knew anything about
addiction, and no one around me talked about it. The women
in NA are very special to me because when I got clean I was
the only one. I was told that as an addict, I should avoid having
children. The fellowship thought that if I had a baby I wouldn't
come to meetings anymore. No one had experience to share
about having children in recovery. Now I know that my recovery
is not short-term--this is a life-long program, and there might
be times when I can't go to meetings. But back then, we thought
that if you couldn't go to a meeting every day then you would go
back to using. We had no history or experience.
  In those first years of NA, we went to AA meetings as well,
and many members, including my AA sponsor, used to tell me,
"How dare you get married and have kids before you get well?"
Those early members didn't have any role models themselves.
My son, who is fourteen years old now, was the first to be born
from a couple active in the NA program in Japan. Everyone
watched him grow. People said that my husband and I were go-
ing to divorce at any moment. We've been together for nineteen
years now. Our life is normal.
  When I first joined NAtwenty-two years ago, there were about
ten members. The seven of us from Tokyo would take the bullet
train to visit three members in Osaka. Every time we got together

                                   292

                                                           Regardless of... 293


we would talk about how to spread the NA message. In the first
five years there was hardly any growth in the fellowship. We had
to look for newcomers. When we heard there was an addict in a
mental institution far away, we would go there and talk through
the bars. We were doing service work with hospitals and institu-
tions and public information on a regular basis, but we had no
connections with physicians. My husband would just walk into
a mental institution and ask if there were any addicts there. He
would go to very small towns in the hills and talk to the addicts
in the institutions, even those who had no intention of stopping.
Once in a while, a hospital would ask us to come back. We would
take the bullet train to go see just one addict. It was very impor-
tant for us to keep doing that. I would go watch TV with women
addicts in mental institutions. Anything. As NA members, what
we really needed was more members.
   Because there were so few of us, I felt a lot of pressure to try to
be a perfect NAmember.At that time, NAwas where very young
men--kids who were fifteen or sixteen--and older Yakuzas
went. When I was new in NA I didn't want to be seen with men
      22

who had tattoos all over their bodies and lizard-leather shoes,
and I was afraid of some of them. It took many years for some of
our members to move on from who they used to be, and to un-
derstand that being a boss on the street is different from being a
sponsor. A perfect NA member attends meetings regularly, but
sometimes it can be really scary for a woman to go to meetings.
   As the fellowship in Japan grew, we translated more NA lit-
erature. Once we were able to read the message in our language,
the program became much clearer. I was shocked to read that
drugs were not the major problem for us, but that the problem
is our obsessive thinking and compulsive behavior. When I read
that I thought, This is it! This is the life I have been living.
   The women in the fellowship were profoundly affected by the
NA message. They would talk about hitting their bottom prior
to using drugs. When anyone stops using, it means dealing with

22Yakuza is the Japanese mafia.

    emotional pain on a daily basis, and women addicts in Japan of-
    ten have abusive relationships in which physical abuse, on top of
    emotional and psychological pain, are part of life. Many women
    shared how drugs were a good thing for them, until their using
    became unmanageable. I didn't understand this until the new
    translation. These women also had a hard time with the word re-
    cover. In Japanese, recover means "to go back to the way you used
    to be." Survivors of abuse don't want to go back to the way they
    used to be. In recovery, they want to move on and grow. People
    who had nothing to start with were afraid that they really had
    nothing to recover. As we started to read the new translations, it
    clarified that women in Japan were sharing the same experience
    as members around the world.
      When we share, our stories light the way for other people. If
    we don't share, we are alone in the darkness. And when we do
    share, our experiences become part of everyone else's experi-
    ence. Many Japanese women addicts shared in meetings about
    their experiences with sexual abuse and domestic violence. It
    was always said that nobody is sexually abused in Japan. Hold-
    ing onto that story kept us alone in the dark. But sharing with
    each other in NA has changed the culture in Japan. All of these
    women addicts began sharing their stories, and now people talk
    about domestic violence and sexual abuse as real problems. No-
    body believed us for so long. I couldn't even believe it myself.
      I had a hard time when my child was born because I was home
    caring for him. My husband was always busy, and so I never
    really was a perfect member because I couldn't go to meetings
    consistently. What I did instead, for my first ten years or so clean,
    was answer calls from NA members at home. Everybody in NA
    knew our home phone number, so it was just like the helpline.
    On a typical day, I would be taking care of my child and answer-
    ing calls about where the meetings were. There are many dif-
    ferent ways to serve the program. Even though I couldn't get to
    meetings regularly, I was still carrying the message.

                                                    Regardless of... 295


   During this hard time, I found a new sponsor in California.
There weren't many experienced NA members in Japan, so it
was necessary for us to go abroad to find members who could
share knowledge about the program. She was so supportive, tell-
ing me, "I am proud of you. You are doing your best. You don't
need to feel guilty."
   I met a group of mothers at the nursery school, and we helped
each other by sharing baby-sitting. This meant I could get to
some NA meetings, but then I was obligated to spend more time
with their babies. I also put NA events over events at my child's
school. He was always involved with NA, and he didn't have
enough connections with other kids. Now I know that working
the Twelve Steps is the most important thing--as long as I work
the Twelve Steps, I can prioritize my life the way that seems right
to me.
   Recently, I lost a large amount of money in business. It was one
of the worst times I have been through, and I didn't know how
to get over it. I had something I believed in and it fell apart. I
began to lose confidence in myself. Because of this hardship and
the loss of my self-confidence, I started to work Steps Six and
Seven. Once I started to see my own defects, that heavy pressure
I felt began to lift. Six months later, I was considering this idea
of sharing my story and describing what makes me happy. What
makes me feel really happy is that right in the midst of this re-
ally difficult time, I realize that I'm a member of NA. I have the
tools I was taught in this program, and I know I can use them to
overcome difficulties. I don't know if I call this happiness, but I
think that being an NA member who has tools makes it possible
to be happy.
   These hard times that I think I won't be able to overcome are
really a gift from my Higher Power, and when it's over I always
feel relieved. I feel the strongest connection with my Higher
Power when I've made a mistake. Making mistakes breaks down
my false beliefs. My Higher Power gives me an opportunity to

296 Narcotics Anonymous


    see clearly what I really believe in: When I think that I know
    what success looks like in business or in my personal relation-
    ships, my Higher Power always gives me a chance to look back
    and see how small my thinking has been. The mistakes that I
    make are the biggest gifts. I know now that the goal is not to be
    perfect. When I first got clean, I thought it was better not to make
    mistakes. But now I have deep respect for those people who, no
    matter how many times they relapse, still come back to the pro-
    gram and try as best they can.
      In those early years, we had a misconception about what it
    meant to be happy in the program. We thought that "happy in
    the program" meant that we became model NA members. Re-
    cently, I was talking with a member who has been in and out of
    the program for many years, in and out of institutions, in and out
    of marriages. When I first heard this, I thought his Higher Power
    wouldn't love him because of his failures. I, on the other hand,
    kept coming back to meetings for a long time and loved only one
    man. I had thought that a Higher Power should love a diligent
    member like me, not him. Thankfully, that way of thinking has
    completely changed within me through working the program. I
    said to him, "Who is actually happier? It could be you or me--
    we don't know. At least I cannot judge."
      No matter how many times you relapse, NA still takes
    you back--that's the NA program. NA doesn't kick you out;
    instead, NA is always here for you. I really can't tell you who
    has the better life--the perfect NA member that I've tried to
    be for the last twenty years or those people who go in and out
    of the program. I just happened to stay clean because I was in-
    volved with the fellowship. I didn't stay clean because I tried so
    hard to stay away from drugs; I stayed clean because of the fear
    that I could not afford not to be the model NA member. I'm not
    that different from those members who relapse. When I think
    that way, I feel lighter. I feel more respect for those members
    who are struggling to stay clean. I believe that the Higher Power

                                                    Regardless of... 297


doesn't discriminate. What makes me the happiest in recovery is
to see change in a fellow addict. It's always a great pleasure and
surprise to see members change. No matter how many times I
witness that change, it still makes me happy.

     When he was new in the program, he learned that, despite his
      professional background and education, he belonged in NA.
        He had stayed clean since his story was published in our
           First Edition and revised it himself for this edition.
               Sadly, he did not live to see its publication.


I Was Unique

I had nowhere to turn. I felt like no one could help me, as my
situation was so much different from others'. I thought that I was
doomed to continue in an insane drive toward self-destruction
that had already sapped me of any determination to fight. I
thought that I was unique--that is, until I found the Fellowship
of Narcotics Anonymous. Since that day, my life has had new
meaning and new direction.
   I came from a white, middle-class background where suc-
cess was almost assumed. I excelled academically and went
on to medical school in California and Scotland. I looked with
smug disdain on my schoolmates who were experimenting with
drugs; I felt I was too good and too smart for that. I thought that
a drug addict was a weak-willed, spineless creature who must
have no purpose in life or sense of worth. I would not, or could
not, fall into that trap, as I was an achiever, winning at the game
of life. I had such great potential.
   Sometime after having started my internship at a prestigious
West Coast hospital, I had my first experience with narcotics. I
thought it was a curiosity; perhaps I was looking for "something
better." I was amazed at the way patients in severe pain would
relax when a small amount of morphine was injected into their
veins. That was for me! Over the next few months my world
crumbled around me. Experimentation quickly led to abuse and
then addiction, with all the bewildering helplessness and self-
condemnation that only the addict knows.

                                                        Regardless of... 299


  Shortly after I started my residency training in neurosurgery,
the delusion that I could control my narcotic use evaporated.
I sought help from a psychiatrist. I was hospitalized in a men-
tal institution for a few days. Once I felt better, I convinced my
psychiatrist that I was well enough to return to my training pro-
gram. He was either naive, gullible, or ignorant of addiction, and
let me go merrily on my way. I lasted a few months before re-
lapsing. With no changes in my thinking or behavior, relapse fol-
lowed relapse, and I established a pattern that I would maintain
for almost ten years. I continued to try psychiatrists and mental
institutions, but after each I would relapse again.
  After having performed many surgical procedures while
loaded, I was asked to leave my residency. Another hospitaliza-
tion followed, and I returned to my pattern of relapse. Besides
institutionalization, I tried job changes, geographical relocation,
self-help books, methadone programs, only using on weekends,
switching to pills, marriage, health spas, diets, exercise, and reli-
gion. None of them worked, other than temporarily. Based upon
my track record, I was told I was incorrigible and that there was
no hope for me.
  After about five years of heavy using, I developed a physical
allergy to my drug of choice. Each time I used, tissue would die
around the injection site. Initially I could prevent the process by
using cortisone, but it returned. In the meantime, I developed all
the attendant side effects of the steroids. By the time I reached my
last hospitalization, my immune system was knocked out and I
was a physical wreck. Worse yet, I was totally demoralized and
suffering from a spiritual bankruptcy of which I was unaware.
The denial and self-deception were so great that I couldn't see
what a pitiful creature I had become.
  I entered a treatment facility. There, for the first time, I was con-
fronted by physicians who were addicts themselves. They asked
me first if I wanted help, and then if I was willing to go to any
lengths to recover. They explained that I might have to lose all my

300 Narcotics Anonymous


    worldly possessions, my practice, my profession, my wife and
    family, even my arm.At first I balked. I figured there was nothing
    wrong with me that a little rest and relaxation could not set right.
    But instead, I made a pact with them: I would listen and take or-
    ders without questioning. I had always been independent, and
    this was certainly a change for me. This was my first introduction
    to the tough love that has helped me so much in NA.
      During that month in the hospital, a great change came over
    me. I was forced to go to outside NA meetings. At first, I was
    rebellious. These people were not like me; they were common
    junkies, dope fiends, pill-heads, tweakers, and coke freaks. How
    could I relate to them? They did not come from where I had.
    They had not experienced what I had experienced. They had
    not achieved what I had achieved. Yet when I listened, I heard
    my story, again and again. These people experienced the same
    feelings, the sense of loss, doom, and degradation, as I did. They
    too had been helpless, hopeless, and beaten down by the same
    hideous monster as I had. Yet they could laugh about their past
    and speak about the future in positive terms. There seemed to be
    such a balance of seriousness and levity, with an overpowering
    sense of serenity. I ached for what they had.
      I heard about honesty, tolerance, acceptance, joy, freedom,
    courage, willingness, love, and humility. But the greatest thing
    I heard about was God. I had no problem with the concept of
    God, as I had called myself a believer. I just could not understand
    why He had let me down. I had been praying to God the way a
    child asks Santa Claus for gifts, yet I still held onto my self-will.
    Without it, I reasoned, I would have no control over my life, and
    could not survive. It was pointed out to me that perhaps that was
    the whole problem. I was told that perhaps I should seek God's
    will first, and then conform my will to His. Today, I pray only for
    His will for me and the power to carry it out on a daily basis, and
    all is well. I have found that His gifts are without number when I
    consistently turn my will and my life over to His care.

   Through the process of studying, writing, working, and ulti-
mately, living the Twelve Steps of Narcotics Anonymous I have
been brought down a path which has led me to a new relation-
shipwiththeGodofmyunderstanding.Thatalonedemonstrates
the power for change that the program can bring about.And that
change, when multiplied through many addicts, will make the
world a better place for all, addict and nonaddict alike.
   Since all that I have gained from my involvement in Narcotics
Anonymous has been freely and unconditionally given to me, it
is incumbent upon me to freely give to others as well. I found one
way I could do this is through service.
   Aspecial form of service for me has been the privilege of spon-
sorship. In order to remind me of my previous xenophobic at-
titudes, God in his infinite wisdom and humor has arranged for
me to sponsor many men of diverse backgrounds. Many times
the only common ground is our common disease of addiction.
Differences in drugs used, ethnic origin, socioeconomic back-
ground, sexual orientation, or spiritual belief system no longer
create barriers to loving, fruitful relationships. Each has taught
me more than I can relate here, and it seems that the "two-way
street" we speak of in relation to sponsorship is heavily weighted
toward my personal growth and awareness. My interaction with
addicts--who had been the objects of my fears--has enriched me
beyond anything I expected when I arrived in the rooms of NA.
   I have found a new home in the Fellowship of NarcoticsAnon-
ymous. I have found my calling in life, and that is to carry the
message to the addict who still suffers. I am so grateful to God
and NA that I can do this today.
   The perception of differences on which I had focused was just
another way my disease could separate me from you and find
me "unqualified" for recovery in NA. I have found that you
people are just like me. I am no longer better than or less than.
I feel a real love and camaraderie in the Narcotics Anonymous
Fellowship. My great spiritual awakening has been that I am an
ordinary addict--I am not unique.

Recovering from addiction is about more than just not using

are graced with gifts. These addicts share about practicing the

Reflections

Hepatitis   C was killing me, so I had to go on medication. I had
to learn to live with syringes in my house. I had to learn to inject
the medicine at the kitchen table with the windows open, not
shoot it like dope in the bathroom with the door closed. Taking
the medication was the most painful thing I've ever done, and
I had to do it for a year. That was a living hell. But it made for
a damn thorough Third Step. It had to, because the treatment
didn't work for me, and I need that faith. The hepatitis is still
with me. I'm still an addict. The steps and my sponsor have
taught me things I never imagined. I'm at peace with the world.
I've got a new way of living. I might go back on the medication. I
might not. I'm leaving that to my doctor and God. It'll work out.
I've got NA. I've got a life.



Awhole     new life started when I went to college, seeking a sense
of self-worth. Life was interesting, challenging, and enjoyable--
pushing against the intellectual and social boundaries I was
used to. Although I was broke most of the time, study was an
incredible experience. My sponsor grew concerned when my
meeting attendance dropped off due to the academic workload.
I kept up contact with my NA support network, though, and
during breaks I crammed in as many meetings as I could. I
completed college with honors and went on to get a university
degree. My children and my sponsor were at my graduation,
and the memory of how proud they were swells my heart. I am
so grateful to NA for the success I've experienced in recovery.

    I'd decided one morning to donate plasma so that I could afford
    a bag of dope. I waited a long time in the plasma center, and
    it seemed strange they did not call my name. Finally, a white-
    robed doctor called me into his office. He bluntly said, "You've
    turned up HIV-positive. You are permanently deferred from the
    plasma program." I walked the streets, feeling numb inside. I
    went on a binge of unparalleled proportions. I wound up in New
    Mexico, nearly dead, and checked into rehab. I remember an ad-
    dict talking about how much he loved NA and its principles. I
    broke down crying, admitting I was an addict, and was able to
    get active in Narcotics Anonymous.
       Some time later I got a girlfriend who had HIV, and she ended
    up dying from AIDS. I had to spoon-feed her and take care of
    her. It was a horrible experience. I recall going to meetings, say-
    ing, "I can stay clean," but really wondering if that was possible.
    The night she died I called my sponsor and another NA friend.
    They came over to support me. After she was taken and every-
    one left, I was scared. What was I to do? And so I started writing
    on my Third Step, and my Higher Power showed me that if I
    didn't use and continued to work a program, there really wasn't
    anything to fear.



    I could not believe I was doing this type of behavior with five
    years clean! I had nothing to blame it on, no excuses to give. I
    wasn't loaded or young and inexperienced. I was responsible,
    and with that awareness I felt dirty and hopeless. I came to un-
    derstand fully the phrase "you're only as sick as your secrets."
       The way to stop the affair, it seemed, was to tell my husband.
    That day began the lowest point in my life; I was intensely
    ashamed. Not only did I betray my husband and the guy's wife,
    but my fellowship was betrayed as well by the ensuing disunity
    the ordeal caused in our small community. I worked the steps
    through this chapter of my life and believe that I'd never have

survived my behavior without the NA program. Eventually my
husband and I reunited. He has taught me unconditional love,
forgiveness, and integrity. Today we both try to help others in
recovery who may be going through this situation.



One    day, while peeling potatoes, I noticed weakness in my
hands. I dismissed it as my arthritis acting up. Then I had numb-
ness and tingling in my legs and feet. Soon after, I was unable
to stand up and walk. I was taken to the emergency room and
was eventually transferred to a physical rehabilitation hospital,
where I was diagnosed with a nerve disorder. I was unable to
attend meetings during this time, and my sponsor helped me
so much. I continued to work on my steps and read my Basic
Text. I missed meetings so much and was lonely for the outside
world. After two years I was able to stand up again and take
a few steps. Now I am able to get around with a walker. I am
so blessed to have had the support of my sponsor and Higher
Power during this tough time. I don't think I could have made it
without them.



Iwas   at my mom's, decorating for the holidays. My wife called,
and she was loaded. She said awful, unrepeatable things to me.
When I got home after decorating, she was on the couch, seem-
ingly passed out. And then I saw my shotgun was lying in front
of her body. I called 911 and stood there in shock, crying and
cursing God. I prayed for his will for her, that something would
happen so she wouldn't have to suffer anymore. I was arrested
and taken as a suspect until suicide was verified as the cause
of death. I had my one phone call and called my sponsor. He
showed up, and the next day the fellowship came and wanted to
help any way they could.

       As time passed, the grief did not. I knew I had to surrender
    it. I could not bring her back, but I could seek sanity for myself.
    Finally someone shared that the answer was faith and not to
    give up five minutes before the miracle. I followed the advice to
    write a letter to her sharing my recovery and the unsaid things
    I needed to say, and felt released from the burden of grief. I let
    God handle it. Sometimes I take my will back, but the pain isn't
    as bad as before.



    The    program has taught me that I can recover from addiction,
    despite my other ailments. I suffer chronic pain and must accept
    that hospitals, doctors, and medication are part of my "right
    now" if I want to stay in NA and out of denial. In the past, I lis-
    tened to people who told me I wasn't clean and could not join
    NA because I had to take medication. I allowed others to run me
    out of the only place I've found relief--the rooms of NA. I've
    been back for almost two years now, and I'm so grateful that I
    have the ability to work the program, just like everyone else. I
    have a sponsor and work the steps. I do service and attend meet-
    ings regularly. Meditation and prayer help reduce my pain. I've
    been able to stay in NA only because I was willing to accept my-
    self. I'm not leaving this time!

       When this addict lost a brother and a son to the disease
   of addiction, his heart was crushed and his faith was challenged.
      Going to meetings and working the steps have helped him
                        to survive so much loss.


Life and Death in NA

Ifirst came to NAin August 1986. I looked for differences, found
them, and used for another year and a half. When I returned, I
surrendered with the willingness to do whatever it took to stay
clean. I took suggestions and made new mistakes, and the emo-
tional peaks and valleys eventually diminished along with my
desire to use.
  I came into this program a father of two awesome sons. When
I had two years clean I was blessed with a third son. Throughout
recovery I have done my best to be a good father. I made mis-
takes, but I also learned to love, protect, and provide for my boys
instead of trying to control, dominate, and fill them with fear as I
had done most of my life. I did not want my boys to live as I had,
with hate, anger, fear, and disregard for life. No matter what
message I carry through words, my boys watch how I act and
react to situations. I had to learn to walk the NA walk and do my
best to practice the principles in all my affairs, because my boys
would mimic my positive traits and my defects of character.
  This program works in mysterious ways. My father told me he
loved me twice in my life: once after the Chicago Bears won the
Super Bowl and once at some New Year's Eve party. But thanks
to NA, the last years of his life were different. He was diagnosed
with cancer in 1996, and as my boys jumped on his hospital bed
they told him, "I love you, Grandpa!" as they did regularly. I was
taught to say "I love you" in NA; I taught my boys, and to my
surprise, my boys taught my father. That day in the hospital, in
front of my own eyes, my macho father responded to my boys, "I
love you too." I stayed close through his struggle; he died about

                                  309

    six months later. Thanks to NA, Dad left this world knowing
    that my boys loved him and with my boys knowing that their
    grandfather loved them. He died at fifty-eight with nineteen
    years clean.
      My brother battled with the disease of addiction for years. He
    knew I went to NA meetings. I would invite him to come along.
    He tried other avenues to deal with the disease, but they were
    only temporary solutions. Addiction always came out on top;
    he was being slowly sucked dry. I was taught in NA to be there
    for any addict seeking recovery. He knew I loved him uncondi-
    tionally, but when he was actively using I had to love him from
    a distance. He also knew I was there to take him to a meeting
    whenever he was ready.
      On the 21st of June 2001 I received a call from a hospital. I was
    told that my brother had been in a terrible accident. I wasn't sure
    how they got my phone number. They wouldn't tell me if he was
    okay, and I knew that wasn't good. I got to the hospital and was
    asked to identify my brother because he hadn't survived. He
    lay bruised and dead: gone forever at the age of thirty-four. He
    had gone to cop, gotten high, and on the way back home he had
    slammed into a viaduct at high speed, dying instantly.
      The day before, he had come to have lunch with me at work (it
    had been a safe time and place to meet). We hung out for a while,
    and as he left he said, "I love you, big brother," and I responded,
    "I love you too." Because of what I learned in the program, the
    last words I shared with my brother were "I love you." Later I
    found out the hospital staff got my name and number because he
    had my business card in his pocket from the day before--thanks,
    NA, for reminding me not to completely shut out struggling ad-
    dicts. I wish he had wanted what we have to offer and had been
    willing to make the effort to get it.
      Once again my heart was crushed, my spirit weakened, and
    my faith challenged. My sons were devastated. I did what I was
    taught to do: work steps, pray, call my sponsor, go to meetings,

                                                 Life on Life's Terms 311


and be there for my loved ones. I needed to be surrounded by
loved ones both inside and outside the rooms of NA. My friends
in the fellowship were there that day as they had been since the
day I got clean. In my heart I know they will always be there.
  Up to now this hasn't been too hard to write because I have
had a few years to grieve those losses. But what I am about to
write I would never want anyone to experience. During the last
nine months I have lost my hope, spirit, and zest for life. I feel a
void where my heart used to be. I have cried more in the last few
months then I have in my entire life.
  About two years ago my oldest son came to live with me, and I
noticed that he had been using. He knew for the last fifteen years
I was an active member of NA. He was no stranger to the dis-
ease of addiction and the terror and destruction that come along
with it. We bumped heads. I sought help from other recovering
addicts to deal with my own son living in active addiction. His
using progressed, and my heart broke the first time I saw him
nodding. Within a year he shared that he saw no hope for his life
or ever getting clean.
  He decided to get help and came to NA in March 2004. We
went to a few meetings together, but he wanted to attend meet-
ings on his own. He started working a program and began shar-
ing with me on a deeper level than ever before. We cleared up
some wreckage of the past, for which I am truly grateful. It felt
good to see him trust the program and begin to clean up some
secrets that haunted him. He started to get that NA glow.
  Our literature tells us that "those who keep coming to our
meetings regularly stay clean," but my son chose not to continue
going to meetings after I left for Afghanistan. I know I cannot
take this program from my soul and hand it to another, even
though I hoped I could have handed it to my son. He relapsed
in late November 2004. I returned from overseas to see my skel-
eton of a son curled up in the fetal position in a hospital after an
overdose. As he awoke, he told me that he was hopeless, and

312 Narcotics Anonymous


    just wanted to sit in a room and use forever. He said he wasn't as
    strong as I was and he couldn't stay clean. I assured him that if I
    could stay clean, so could he. My stomach was in knots.
      Because I had been away from the area so long, I decided to
    do ninety meetings in ninety days to get to know some of the
    local recovering addicts and get involved again in NA service. I
    know that if I hadn't done this "ninety in ninety" and strongly
    refreshed my foundation, what was about to happen would have
    spiritually crippled me.
      My son went into another treatment center in early December,
    but didn't want visits and rarely called. When he did call me
    from treatment I asked if he was going to NA meetings. He said,
    "The guys from NA stopped coming around Christmastime."
    At the end of January he decided to move to a halfway house
    in California. I was against the idea when he told me. I told him
    that he had relapsed so badly the last time, I was afraid I might
    not see him alive again. I was teary when I went to hug him and
    say good-bye before he left for the train station with his mom.
    He saw my watery eyes and asked if I was okay. I was speechless
    by this time, and nodded yes. He knew I didn't want him to go.
    I was powerless over his decision.
      He left treatment on 3 February and headed for the halfway
    house on 5 February, the same day I started as panel leader for
    the new hospitals and institutions meeting we started on the unit
    my son had just left.
      He called me a week later from the halfway house. He sounded
    really worried and said he was scared because he and his room-
    mates had relapsed the night before. Then he said the words I
    was hoping for: "I want to come home." I felt cautiously relieved,
    because I know using addicts will say anything for money. I sent
    him a nonrefundable train ticket. He left the next day and was
    coming home to live with me and my other son. The next day, I
    got a call from his mother. I thought she was just confirming that
    I was going to pick him up at the train station. I was wrong.

                                                     Life on Life's Terms 313


   She was crying hysterically and blurted out, "Our son is
dead!" I didn't want to believe it--he was almost home. My heart
sank as she told me that he was found dead in a bathroom on
the train in Kansas City. My wonderful, fun, outgoing, family-
oriented, respectful, loving son is dead at twenty-one. He did
one more, and it killed him. I will never hold my son again, I
will never laugh with my son again. I will never fish or go to the
movies with my son again. My niece says he lives in our hearts.
But I am selfish: I want him here next to me. He was supposed
to outlive me.
   Living with this life-changing nightmare has been challeng-
ing. Seeing my own son in a casket ripped my heart out. I have
already gone through all of the what ifs, could haves, should
haves, and if onlys. I did the best I could. I loved him uncondi-
tionally, and was always there for him.
   Working steps has reduced the guilt and regret I felt. I have
learned to let the people I love, respect, and admire know the im-
pact they make in my life. I also must be there for my family and
friends who are dealing with tragedies, even if I am uncomfort-
able and don't know what to say. I just need to be by their side;
no magic words necessary.
   The bottom line is that if it weren't for Narcotics Anonymous
I would not have had the tools to deal with losing my father,
brother, or most of all, my son. The journey continues. More les-
sons await me in the meetings, and in the meetings before and
after the meetings. In the last nine months there have been four
deaths from overdose in our area. Death from the disease of ad-
diction is real. This is a serious disease that kills. But today I have
a choice.
   Yes, there is loss and pain in recovery, but the journey in NA
has also been far more rewarding than I could ever have imag-
ined. To name only a few of the dreams coming true, since being
clean I am the only child out of seven to earn a bachelor's de-
gree. I have traveled around the world and have been fortunate

314 Narcotics Anonymous


    enough to go to NA meetings in Japan, Turkey, India, and Ma-
    laysia. Last year I was in Germany, Uzbekistan, and Afghanistan.
    The journey continues as I slowly learn to live with the pain of
    losing my wonderful, outgoing, handsome son. I hope he watches
    over me and his brothers.
       I do not blame God or anyone else for my son's death. He
    chose to put the needle in his arm; death was the result. He was
    coming home to me, but somewhere along the trip home the dis-
    ease of addiction did what it does best.
       Now I know that life is precious, and I try to send the flowers
    before the funeral. I do my best to reach out to the newcomers,
    always. I continue to do the same things that kept me clean the
    first ninety days.

     Even in a remote corner of paradise, the disease can find us--
     and so can recovery. She kept coming back, and found freedom
                   through fearless inventory work.

Breath of Life

I have  no problem accepting the fact that I was born an addict.
It's in my genes. Where I grew up I was the only white kid, or
Haole, in my class. In Hawaiian, "ha ole" means without breath
or life spirit. With my red hair and freckles, I was so white I felt
repulsive. People would look at me and say, "What is wrong
with her? She looks sick. She's so white!" I felt a lot of shame. In
fourth grade I asked my brother to draw a big chain-and-anchor
tattoo on my arm. My dad was in the Navy, and that year we had
a Chilean sea captain staying at our house. I wanted to be him--
or Pippi Longstocking, who was really rich, was strong enough
to lift a horse, had a pet monkey, and stayed mostly alone. She
looked like me.
   I had been molested by various people--friends' parents,
baby-sitters, and people in the neighborhood--since kindergar-
ten. It made me hard inside. I froze my heart and also found my
worth. I became an object, and my sexuality became my only
power. It's where I got my validation, where I believed I had my
strength and my skills.
   I was already walking the streets in Waikiki at fifteen years
old. I found recovery when I was a teenager, but I came in and
out of the rooms for many years. I would sit in the back of the
meeting and say nothing. I would ask a woman to sponsor me
because I needed a name when someone asked me, "Who's your
sponsor?"
   Because of my addiction and the ways and means I used to get
more, I caused a lot of harm to myself and others. No amount of
degradation would kill the pain I carried inside me. I relapsed
many times. I lost pregnancies. I was riddled with disease,


                                  315

316 Narcotics Anonymous


    shame, fear, and anger. At one point I was living in a crack house
    in East LA and I had one dress. It was actually supposed to be a
    tube top. I was filthy. I lived like an animal. From my window,
    I would watch the ladies at the bus stop going to their jobs and
    hanging laundry in their small, fenced-in yards. I was dying. My
    spirit was dying. I asked God, "Why can't I have that? Why can't
    I have just a simple life? I don't need much. I just want to feel...
    to be decent." With what resources I could gather I moved to a
    rural and remote corner of Hawaii. I didn't know anyone there.
       I asked God to help me to help myself. I was desperate. I called
    the hotline and went to an NA meeting. There were three people
    at the table. They all shared and then they all looked at me! It
    was time to open my mouth and speak. I began to stick around
    the rooms. We were a small group. We would hang together: go
    to a meeting, a movie, to the diner. We'd drink coffee all night
    and talk. We'd call each other and check in before bed, and wake
    up to another day clean. I put some days together. I went to
    gatherings in our region, and I realized that people on other is-
    lands were clean. Then I went to a convention and I found there
    were people in other states, and even in other countries, who
    are clean! My life in recovery began to expand, and the darkness
    could not stay. I was letting in the light of recovery.
       I made a decision, and a spiritual life became real. I began
    to feel a little freedom. Suddenly, I had choices. I went back to
    school and graduated with a degree. I made some amends and
    got my legal problems worked out. I dedicated myself to service
    in the program.
       At a certain point I became very serious. I was able to focus
    a little bit better and I used--no, I wielded--the traditions and
    our policy in service like a sword. Someone told me, "If everyone
    lived by the rule of an eye for an eye, we would all be blind." I
    had to stop putting out the eyes of those around me in service.
    I learned that my life depends on NA unity, and I needed to get
    tougher skin and a softer heart.

                                                    Life on Life's Terms 317


   I began to realize that I was still practicing behaviors that were
killing me. I had to give it up. I had given my sponsor invento-
ries that addressed crimes against society and institutions, but I
hadn't given up the "crimes against me." The results of holding
onto that shame of the past had me acting out in dishonesty, vio-
lent anger, sexual addiction, serial relationships, gambling, retail
therapy, debt, and anorexia-bulimia. It was full-blown addiction
without dope. These behaviors are defects of character that stand
in the way of my living a full life. I had a taste of what freedom
could be, but I didn't know how to get it. I was exhausted.
   I had some beliefs stuck inside that were killing me. All of my
anger and resentments from the past, my childhood, my mis-
takes, my grief, my loss--that pain so deep, no amount of beastly
behavior could dull it--had to go. If I didn't let go of all of it, I
wasn't going to live. In tears, I wrote it all out on paper. I found a
sponsor who was like a surgeon when it came to inventories. She
said, "Are you ready to meet yourself?" I thought, I don't know.
What will happen when I let this out of me? I was afraid. She told
me, "HP is right here, right now. We are loved and it's safe." So I
gave it up, and after I did I felt relief. I wondered why I didn't do
this sooner! I felt alive, and you know what? I felt clean. I real-
ized that clean is the new high! This was step work? I liked it! I
learned that I wasn't going to get hurt by this. I also knew I had
a lot more work to do. Construction was under way.
   I love my sponsor. She helps me to live by spiritual principles.
She looks deep into my eyes and reflects me back to me. She has
loved me whether I brought grace or petty meanness to the table,
and she has taught me to love myself despite it all. I realized
that I was not one person; I couldn't be after being so fractured.
I am really divided into three people. There is "lower me;" that
is the addict. She can be dishonest, can pinch a baby when no
one is looking. She's the one who smoked your bail money. This
is still a part of me. Then there is "middle me;" she is a citizen.
She pays her taxes; pays her bills; is a good daughter, sister, wife,

318 Narcotics Anonymous


    and worker. She is decent. She is a trusted servant. She can show
    up and be accountable. She is generous and funny and loving.
    "Higher me" is my exact nature: who my HP intends for me to
    be. This is the part of me that is compassionate, nonjudgmental,
    open-minded, and full of grace. This part of me is pure light and
    pure love. When I first sponsored someone, I asked, "How do I
    do this? What kind of role is this? What kind of voice do I need?
    I learned that if I am just human, a recovering addict as I am, and
    I allow HP to lead us both, it will all be okay. My HP sends me
    people so that I can learn about myself.
       Secure in the love of this fellowship and working the steps,
    I have begun to heal. I have learned forgiveness for those who
    harmed me when I was little. This is possible! Those memories
    sadden me, but I no longer have to carry them as a burden. I have
    come to understand our four-sided symbol as a framework for
    living: Self, God, Society, and Service. That is the foundation for
    how I live this program and how I work the steps.
       I have learned how to transform my anger into creative ac-
    tion. I have learned how to disagree and even argue, and still get
    along. I have learned healthy patterns in relationships and with
    family. I have learned that goodwill means that I believe that ev-
    erything another person does or believes in is as important as my
    own actions or beliefs. That's a simple statement, but it has led
    to a very intricate path of discovery. Some very surprising things
    have happened, and I know that this is the magic of recovery. I
    will be working a step, and the moment I am ready, a veil will
    be pulled from my eyes and I will see the truth. This is a path to
    freedom.
       I feel high on life. I laugh from the bottom of my belly with my
    mouth wide open. I feel joy and unselfconsciousness. I feel on a
    very deep level. I have conscious contact. Prayer and meditation
    have brought me a connection to others and to my HP that ad-
    diction had made impossible. Addiction separates me from life.
    NA has allowed me to find my way to my heart, to listen to it, to

                                                Life on Life's Terms 319


think from it. My heart isn't frozen anymore. It's warm. It feels
like the difference between sitting in the shade and sitting in the
sun. I am so grateful. I have been given the breath of life. Thank
you, Narcotics Anonymous.

      This Indian addict believes "there are no bad days, only good
     days and learning days," and he has learned a lot in recovery.
          Perhaps most importantly, he has learned how to love
                       and to trust the process.


Just Say Yes

I  grew up in a traditional Indian Sikh family, where even
smoking cigarettes is taboo. The Sikhs are a martial people, and
"Sardar," the Indian word for Sikh, means leader. Because Sikhs
can be identified by their turbans, I was a very visible user. A
Sikh who smokes is a disgrace to the community, and I was
using. Even the dealers called me "Smacky Sardar."
   I lived at least two lives, my professional life and my addict
life. I graduated from a very good school, though I had managed
to get suspended for a year because, on an impulse, I took off to
the mountains with an urge to "do mushrooms." In the begin-
ning, I worked in go-getting corporate environments, and then,
because it became harder and harder to reconcile the demands
of work with the needs of an addict, I went to teach in the moun-
tains. My rationalization was that I didn't want to be in the rat
race. I gave impassioned lectures to anyone who would listen
about doing something meaningful. But I think what attracted
me most was the laid-back lifestyle, and the great marijuana
that grew outside my cottage. A cottage on a cliff in a residential
school was an easy place to isolate. At first it was fun, and then
it became hellish. I couldn't handle the loneliness, so I went back
to the city to look for a job.
   With each switch, assimilating into the new environment got
harder. From the beginning, guilt, shame, and fear were part
of my using. I did many geographics in active addiction to get
away--from the people who loved me because I was unable
to bear looking into their eyes, from the jobs I could no longer
keep, from the friends I had let down. I thought if I changed my

circumstances, I would finally get my life together. I believed
that my problem was that I was just born in the wrong place
at the wrong time--I was supposed to be a rock star in sixties
California; instead I was an Indian computer software guy in the
nineties.And you know the story: Ultimately I couldn't keep jug-
gling. For me, hearing that my life had become unmanageable
was a relief: You had given my condition a name.
   I came to my first meeting like most addicts do--hopeless,
desperate, and suicidal. I got there just as the meeting was end-
ing. As I walked in, two people on either side grabbed my hand
and said the Serenity Prayer. I learned an important lesson that
day--put one hand in the hand of a newcomer and one hand in
the hand of an experienced member, and you don't have a hand
to pick up. Outside the meeting, a man spoke to me and shared
his story. He started saying things I had felt, things I hadn't told
anyone. Finally he described things I hadn't even told myself,
but when I heard them, they resonated in the depths of my be-
ing. He had given voice to my feelings. Someone understood.
And he said, "You never have to feel like this again. You never
have to be alone again. Just keep coming back." He became my
first sponsor. I haven't used since that day.
   The next day I told my best friend, with whom I'd used for ten
years, that I'd been to a meeting and asked whether he'd like to
come. I don't know why I asked him, or, more remarkably, why
he said yes. I had my first successful twelfth step call even before
I knew there were Twelve Steps! Getting clean and staying clean
with him has been one of the pleasures of my recovery.
   Like many people, I came to NA an agnostic. When my spon-
sor asked me to pray, I said I didn't believe in God and so I con-
sidered praying to be hypocritical. He laughed so much that
tears came from his eyes. But he asked me to pray anyway--
"Just say the words." And I did. I was hurting so much I was
willing to do anything. And one day I woke up and I believed in
a power greater than me: A loving, caring Higher Power became

322 Narcotics Anonymous


    the God of my understanding. I discovered the principle that ac-
    tion comes before feeling. Prayer had to come before belief. To
    all the slogans we have in NA, I want to add one: The Cornier It
    Sounds, the Better It Works!
       Twenty days after I came to NA, I lost my job. My sponsor said
    that was probably what I needed. I had little to do but hang out
    with NA members, go to meetings, write my steps, and get in-
    volved with service. My recovery motto became "Just Say Yes."
    Whatever you asked me to do, I said okay. I was willing to go to
    any lengths.
       When I was a year clean, I moved to Qatar in the Persian Gulf.
    Suddenly I was in a new job in a foreign country and with only
    two meetings a week--of AA. The first few months I spent half
    my salary calling my sponsor in India. He didn't just tell me
    stuff; he held my hand and walked me through the day--on
    some days, minute by painful minute. I'd wake up with a knot of
    fear in my stomach and just want to die. I'd call my sponsor 3,000
    miles away to hear him say, "Have a shower and call me back."
    I'd call him back and he'd say, "Have breakfast and call me back."
    I discovered that breakfast is a spiritual principle: With honesty,
    open-mindedness, willingness, and breakfast, we're well on our
    way.
       I'd get to work and be okay for a while. Then the paper would
    get stuck in the printer and I'd look at the paper and think, "What
    am I printing? What am I even doing here? This is meaningless.
    I should just kill myself." In those days, I used to go from serene
    to suicidal in three seconds. I couldn't control the feelings, but
    each time I felt that rage and frustration, I would run to the toilet.
    I spent a lot of time in the toilets as I did in my using days, only
    this time it was for the privacy to pray.
       My sponsor suggested that I get someone in Qatar to sponsor
    me. The idea of developing another sponsorship relationship, es-
    tablishing intimacy with another person, seemed overwhelming.
    Despite my resistance, I was willing and took action. There was

                                                 Life on Life's Terms 323


no NA in Qatar so I asked someone from AA to sponsor me. I
worked the steps from The NA Step Working Guides. Every morn-
ing I sat for an hour and wrote answers to the interminable ques-
tions. My new sponsor made a copy of the guide and studied it
so he could help me. He was a tolerant and humble man. When
I looked at what I wrote, it all seemed wrong and meaningless
and I couldn't see what the benefits of all this writing would be,
but I know now that's not the point. What was important was the
hour I committed to my recovery every day. By doing it every
day, I have progressed through the steps, not perfectly but to the
best of my ability.
   I believe what really helped me was that I was willing: Because
there were only two meetings a week in Qatar, I started going to
NA meetings in Internet chat rooms. I even had a service posi-
tion; I was the secretary of one of the online meetings. Even if no
one else showed up, I'd do the meeting protocol, type my share,
and think, "And this is what they call being restored to sanity!"
   A year later I moved to Oman. It was hard: Moving every
year meant building new relationships, trusting new people ev-
ery time. I found another recovering addict, and we started an
NA meeting. People started to come to the meetings. My friend
whom I'd twelfth-stepped moved to Oman, and we had an NA
Fellowship. My home became the NA hangout. We met, talked
about recovery, had meetings, and discussed hospitals and insti-
tutions and public information initiatives. I had a sponsee, and
we worked the steps together.
   Then I got involved in an unhealthy relationship. I was in
Oman, a foreign, Islamic country, and the price of getting caught
in that relationship was unimaginable, but I could not stop. Once
again, I knew the meaning of powerlessness. I felt fear, guilt, and
shame, and one of the most precious gifts of recovery slowly dis-
appeared: I no longer felt good about myself. My contact with
the God of my understanding was poor. I went to meetings, but
I could no longer share honestly. I believed what saved me was

324 Narcotics Anonymous


    sponsorship. I continued to share honestly with my sponsor.
    I made many attempts to break this obsession, but each time,
    I failed. Finally, my sponsor said, "This is too dangerous--for
    your recovery and for your life. Quit your job and go back to In-
    dia and start over." I wanted to argue, fight, rant--I had worked
    hard and did not want to give up my professional success. But
    I've learned to listen for guidance. That day I went home and
    prayed, "God, if this is your will for me, then I accept. But if there
    is a way, please take this obsession away. I can't do it."
       The next morning, my boss called me to his office and told
    me that our company had gotten a big contract in Bahrain, and I
    would have to move immediately. God's solutions have always
    amazed me. A friend of mine said, "There are no bad days, only
    good days and learning days." In every situation I can ask the
    God of my understanding, "What is your will for me? What am
    I supposed to learn here?" I can practice this in all my affairs.
    Even at work I can ask, "What can I bring to this situation?"
    rather than "What can I take away from it?" When I practice this
    approach, I usually end up a winner.
       My sponsor made me write about this fascination I had with
    attached women--my fear of commitment. "The only way to
    live is to walk through fear. It's time for you to get married," he
    said. I had always held up my willingness as a flag, and so I said,
    "Okay. But it takes two to be married."
       "Do it the traditional Indian way. Ask your mother to find you
    a girl," he said.
       "What about love?"
       "Love is action," he said. "You'll learn love. You will propose
    to a part of the anatomy, but your mother, she will find you a
    woman with whom you can make a life, spend a lifetime."
       He also asked me to tell her about my addiction and about
    NA. I thought that would be the solution. I'd tell her my war sto-
    ries, and she'd say, "Who the hell wants to marry this maniac?"
    and that would be that. I could follow my sponsor's directions,

                                                  Life on Life's Terms 325


and I wouldn't have to get married. That was my plan. God's will
was obviously different. She heard my story, and she was sup-
portive and empathized with me immediately. We were married
shortly after.
   The day before my first wedding anniversary, my wife's bags
were packed. She was ready to leave the next morning--for
good. I remember thinking, man, you took the willingness thing
too far that time. You shouldn't have gotten married.
   That evening, I went to a traditions workshop conducted by
someone who was visiting. I wasn't really excited by this work-
shop. I thought of the traditions as dry. But I was miserable and
confused, and I thought I would kill some time there. I heard
something I will never forget: The person sharing on the First
Tradition said, "As long as staying clean is more important than
getting loaded, you stay clean. As long as preserving your group
is more important than being right, you'll be okay." I went home,
hugged my wife, and said, "I'm willing to put in the effort to
make this work." From that day our relationship changed and I
fell in love. I never thought of the traditions as dry again.
   When I work the Eleventh Step and ask for my sponsor's
help, whatever decision I make is the right one. I learned that at
a traditions meeting, too. At our NA group, a member worried
that in this country, where we were likely being watched, guys
who were still using could endanger the meetings. The group
discussed the First Tradition--our common welfare must come
first, without the meetings no one will recover; the Third Tradi-
tion--the only requirement for membership is a desire to stop
using; the Fifth Tradition--our primary purpose is to carry the
message to the addict who still suffers. I got the opportunity to
speak to someone from world services at a workshop, and asked
him what decision he would have made without telling him
what we'd done. And he said, "It doesn't really matter what you
eventually decided. I already know you made the right decision,
because your group used the tools--you had a discussion, talked

326 Narcotics Anonymous


    about the traditions, and then arrived at a decision." It was a
    huge lesson for me--trust the process.
      Where I live now, the NA Fellowship is rapidly growing. I
    don't think I have felt as much at home anywhere as I feel here.
    I shared my intimate secrets with NA, and did not get rejected.
    So I started to open up even more. Through these relationships,
    I am learning intimacy in my other relationships--with my wife,
    my colleagues at work, and my parents. I have learned to trust,
    make myself vulnerable, and ask for help, especially in things
    I have had no experience with--from what to do for my wife's
    birthday to how to make amends to my father.
      One day at a time, I have come to understand that love is ac-
    tion. I have a life and a partner, and every day I am faced with
    choices. I find making decisions hard. They say that with con-
    tinuing recovery we will have a clearer idea of who we are and
    what we want. But it's still not automatic for me. Getting mar-
    ried, moving house, working abroad--in all my big life events, I
    have been supported and helped by the fellowship. Not only has
    NA changed me, it has made me comfortable with change.

        When she had years clean, depression almost killed this
       recovering addict. But a renewed commitment to recovery
    brought relief and a deeper relationship with her Higher Power.

Inside Job

My    using was much the same as anybody else's; my drug of
choice was more! As long as I was out of reality and didn't have
to face life, it was okay with me. But after a while I lost the will to
live. I was constantly in court for crimes that my addiction made
me commit. I progressed from shoplifting, to picking pockets, to
stealing my own children's presents, to crimes I cannot mention.
I didn't care as long as I achieved oblivion.
  My children lived my addiction with me; they saw the drugs,
the crime, the death, the police raids, the illness, the isolation,
the misery of an existence that I had the cheek to call "life." As
long as they were at school every day so I could go make money,
I didn't care, even when they were ill.
  That's nineteen years in a nutshell: day after day the same sad
reality of living with a disease that wanted to kill me, and torture
for those who had the misfortune to be part of my life.
  I reached a living hell. My partner had gone, my kids were be-
ing taken away, and I was on my way back to prison. I had been
offered help over the years but had always refused to take it.
Pride, stubbornness, and the love of drugs were killing me and
my kids. A doctor said that if I didn't stop using he gave me six
months to live. "Yeah, yeah," I thought. "They always say that."
But it stuck. Something (now I call that something "God") told
me, "Change or die." I asked for help, and my journey into re-
covery began.
  And what a journey! In treatment I was told I had to attend a
Narcotics Anonymous meeting. I was so terrified, I can't begin
to describe the fear. I hid in the wardrobe; I was not going to any



                                   327

328 Narcotics Anonymous


    meeting, and what did the bastards do? Grassed me up (life     23

    savers, more like), and I was put on the bus. I sat in that meet-
    ing but didn't hear a thing besides what was in my own head.
    I was so crippled with self-obsession that I was afraid to go to
    the toilet. It was hell. I kept going back, at first because I had to,
    and thank God I did have to. Somewhere in that time I started to
    hear, and started to have some hope, and started to laugh, and
    started to understand a little bit, and started to want to live!
       Then treatment ended; it was down to me. I attended two
    meetings a day for the first year, raised my hand for all commit-
    ments, completed none of them, changed sponsors four times
    because it was time to do Step Four! Like I was going to tell them
    who I was; I didn't bloody know who I was. So this was my first
    year: meetings, sponsors, making friends; learning very slowly
    how to shop, dress, eat, communicate, pay bills; learning how
    to be a mother--basic living skills. I would drive illegally and
    think that the police wouldn't pull me over because "they should
    know how well I am doing!" That's insanity, but that was my
    thinking in the first year, and you know what? I loved it! I felt
    like I belonged somewhere at last.
       I was pretty much nuts, but started to get a life together. I at-
    tended meetings regularly. I got a new sponsor and made a deci-
    sion to turn most of my will over. I knew that I needed to move
    forward with the steps or I would stay mad and possibly use
    again. This was the beginning of real honesty, open-mindedness,
    and willingness for me, and practicing these principles opened
    the door for growth and healing.
       I went to college for four years and got a job I was good at. My
    children returned to live with me. I traveled. I had and lost my
    first clean relationship. Life was fun. I loved being clean, being
    part of a fantastic fellowship that really did feel like a family.
       Then, all of a sudden, I started to sink. A depression set in on
    me. It got bleak, dark, hopeless. I carried on, thinking, "This too
    shall pass." I attended meetings daily, shared, talked to friends,

    23Informed the authorities; snitched (UK slang)

                                                   Life on Life's Terms 329


went to work, and tried to live as normally as I could. But it
didn't pass. Two months went to three, four, five, and I was
working and going home to bed, not attending meetings, not an-
swering the phone, not eating. It felt like I was in a black hole and
couldn't climb out. "It isn't supposed to be like this," my head
screamed. I remember sitting on the bottom of my stairs and
rocking, holding my ribs because of the physical pain, it hurt so
much. I was sobbing and shouting, "Help me." I thought about
using, anything to relieve the pain, but I knew that using was not
the solution. Using would only make it worse. Then I thought
the solution was death; I wanted to die. I was seven years clean
and hit an emotional rock bottom in recovery. I had tried every-
thing to fix me except truly getting a loving higher power in my
life. Work, shopping, boyfriend, sex had been my gods, and I
didn't even know it. I phoned my sponsor and asked for help. I
started to go to meetings again.
   Since this time I have worked on the most important rela-
tionship in my life: the one with my higher power, God. I have
come to realize that no people, places, or things can ever make
me whole, but the program of Narcotics Anonymous will. The
phrase "it's an inside job" was so difficult for this addict to un-
derstand, but it is so true. I am involved in more service than
ever. I was the chairperson of our area convention last year
and am involved again this year, and I am vice chair of the area
service committee. I love it and the relationships I make doing
service. I regularly attend meetings, help the newcomer, and
try to be grateful. Today I seek peace of mind and contentment
through working the program of Narcotics Anonymous.

    Among the challenges this addict has faced in his thirty years
     clean are cancer and open-heart surgery. From it all, he has
                  learned about surrender and love.

God Walked In

When     I first came to Narcotics Anonymous I didn't think I
could go without drugs for thirty hours, let alone thirty years. I
was terrified NAwasn't going to work for me. I had tried religion
and psychiatry and the military. Being a veteran, I thought that
the government would and could save me, but they couldn't. I
walked into my first meeting of Narcotics Anonymous alone--
behind me was jail, hospitals, violence, foster homes, a sick
mother dependent on food stamps and government welfare,
and a dad who abandoned us. A couple of members took me to
a house where there were other addicts living clean. I didn't eat
or sleep for days, but I found the message of recovery.
   One of the gifts I've received in NA has been falling in love
and getting married to my wife. We have been together now
for twenty-six years, and we have been faithful to each other all
these years. Before I met my wife, I was a pretty rough and reck-
less guy; there's no question that working the steps has helped
me have a relationship with her. After we had been together for
five years, my wife told me that she needed intimacy. I wished
she had asked me for a million dollars--giving her that would
have been easier for me. And at first I thought she meant sex, but
it wasn't about sex; it was about sharing who I am with her. The
steps have given me the courage to be honest and intimate with
another human being.
   NarcoticsAnonymous has also given me the ability not only to
hold a job, but to work my way up from the bottom of a company
to the position of vice president. I never got out of ninth grade,
so to be vice president of an industry leader was an accomplish-
ment. I showed up to work every day, I was disciplined, and I


                                 330

                                                  Life on Life's Terms 331


was trustworthy. When I went to work it didn't matter if I was
going to be accepted or promoted or hired or fired; what mat-
tered was staying clean and trying to go with the truth I found
in the steps.
  When I was two years into my job, the company hired a clini-
cal psychologist to pick everyone's brain. I told my wife that they
were going to find out who I was and fire me. When I went to
meet with this man I had told myself I was going to lie, but then
he started to ask me all these questions and I ended up sharing
the equivalent of my inventory with him.After it was over I knew
he was going to have to give me up. But he said that although the
company executives did need to hear about what I had told him,
they also needed to hear what he was going to tell them--that he
had never felt the same kind of honesty and integrity that I had
shared with him from anyone in his whole career. He wanted to
thank me, and said he would hire me in a heartbeat.
  I have also been blessed with opportunities to serve and give
back to the fellowship. One of the most profound things that hap-
pened for me was when I had procrastinated and had no speaker
for an H&I commitment, forcing me to do the panel at a hospital
detox unit by myself. Even though I had time clean, I was still in-
timidated to go there by myself. It was a coed panel with dually
diagnosed addicts--most of them with physical challenges and
many who were wartime vets. I was setting up the literature and
taking everyone's inventory because I was afraid and it made
me feel better. A guy would walk in and I would say to myself,
"I've done more than him;" a woman would walk in and I would
say, "She's going to think I'm weak." Finally, God walked in.
And God walked in in the form of a person who looked like he
came from the same clan I came from--he had similar tattoos,
he combed his hair in the same way, and the only difference be-
tween him and me was that he was escorted in by two orderlies.
He was what they call a frozen addict. He had put a needle in his
arm with synthetic heroin, and it had frozen him for his entire

332 Narcotics Anonymous


    life. Inside this man, his mind was going a mile a minute, but on
    the outside he was drooling all over himself. He would never
    be able to speak to another person, let alone pick up the phone
    or write a step. How could I take this man's inventory? At that
    moment I knew, in a way I hadn't before, that we are all in this
    together, and there but for the grace of God go I. I knew that if I
    could do anything for that man it would be to think of him when
    I feel like complaining about not wanting to do an inventory or
    pick up the phone. When I spoke at the detox that night, tears
    were coming out of his eyes--this man changed my life.
       When I celebrated twenty-two years clean I hit a series of dif-
    ficult situations. First, after being with my employer for twenty
    years, I was terminated in a corporate downsizing. I was given a
    few hours'notice, and I was gone. I felt abandoned, embarrassed,
    and ashamed. A week went by and my mother-in-law, whom I
    loved deeply, died. My wife was then physically attacked by a
    family member, and it took all my strength not to attack back.
    I struggled to find a permanent career for about a year and a
    half, and my finances were seriously affected. And just when I
    was meeting with some executives for a big job, my eyes went
    crossed and I couldn't see straight. I had a stroke. In the hospital,
    I was told I had had three strokes due to a heart defect. I had a
    hole in my heart and would have to have open-heart surgery so
    they could close the hole and save my life. I got real angry at God
    and felt like I didn't get clean to experience this misery. One more
    time my sponsor reminded me that we must handle life on life's
    terms and that we are blessed to have the support of a loving God
    and a program of recovery. After I had my open-heart surgery I
    was in intensive care, and there were all these tubes coming out
    of me. I was coming off anesthesia and the pain was insane--I
    couldn't speak, and I was so thirsty. I had my family and loved
    ones around, but there was this one person in particular--I knew
    it was a male figure--who seemed like he could read my mind.
    If I was thirsty he would swab my mouth; when I was in pain he

                                                    Life on Life's Terms 333


rubbed my feet. Eventually I found out that this man was an ad-
dict whom I hadn't seen in many years. He had heard that I was
in intensive care and worked his way through the hospital and
got in with my family and just kind of took over. My family was
watching this man be so loving to me--I still get emotional about
it. To me, that sums up this program.
   I wish I could say it all got better after that. It did in a deep
spiritual way, but I continued to have physical challenges. Two
years after my open-heart surgery I was diagnosed with cancer. I
was still not working steadily, and found out I had an aggressive
cancer. I prayed and cried and talked, and then one more time I
surrendered to a loving higher power. It was so humbling and
freeing at the same time. I had radical surgery and was informed
that all of the cancer was gone. With all my physical challenges,
one of my biggest fears was getting hooked on prescribed medi-
cation. I read In Times of Illness and had my medication moni-
tored by my sponsor and sponsees; the miracle is that I did not
get an obsession to use.
   Recently I found out that the cancer has come back and that
the last three readings have been higher and higher. The last time
I saw the oncologist I was told that they want me to go through
eight weeks of daily radiation. They tell me that chances are very
good that I'll be cured from this cancer. I'm still surrendering.All
of this has changed me profoundly. And yet, the truth is that the
fear and anxiety that go along with being diagnosed with cancer
and having open-heart surgery pale in comparison to how I felt
when I walked through the doors of NA. The fear, loneliness,
and isolation that I had back then were way worse than what I'm
going through now. I've been very well supported by my friends
in NA, particularly the oldtimers. I did have some sponsees pull
away--one who, when I told him about the cancer, jumped up
and said, "How can you do this? My father did this same thing."
I knew where he was coming from. He started crying and tried
to leave, and I said, "This is not about you; you know that."

       There have definitely been challenges in dealing with all the
    illness. When they start taking out your prostate and your lymph
    nodes and other parts, having sex is an issue. What bothered me,
    even though my wife and I don't have children, was that I could
    never father children. It just blew me away. All these things were
    hitting me at once. I had to work on surrendering to the reality
    that I'm not going to have any children and that my name is not
    going to carry on. What I've received from this process is a deep
    feeling of wanting to be of service--not only to the fellowship of
    NA, which I love so much, but to humankind. As a result of be-
    ing clean all these years I have had the opportunity to grow older
    physically and experience what all human beings have to face:
    health issues, financial ups and downs, family and friends going
    through life's challenges and changes, and ultimately facing our
    physical mortality. I have been blessed to move through all of
    life's colors over the years, but without the steps, my NA family,
    and the principles that I have learned, these life changes would
    have been much more difficult to cope with and also celebrate.
    I believe that the longer I'm on this planet, the more wisdom I
    develop, but I also believe that that wisdom deepens and I end
    up going full circle to a profound state of innocence, and what a
    freedom that innocence brings.
       I've been through a lot and I want to get mad at God, but I
    know all of this is not about God or being mad at God. These
    challenges have taught me about Love. The Love has been the
    hardest thing for me to accept in my recovery. And what's even
    harder is accepting and giving myself that Love. What a pro-
    found gift--to Love and be Loved. I thank NA, my sponsor, and
    especially the Twelve Steps for continuing to teach me.

      Writing her story from a hospice, this HIV-positive lesbian
         tells how she survived great adversity to find grace
                       in some unlikely places.


One Potato

I am writing this from an AIDS hospice in Toronto, Ontario,
Canada, where I am currently residing. I surrendered to the
disease of addiction and found recovery in 1983. When I first
walked into our rooms, I found every reason possible to not
want to be there. I was the only lesbian, the only native person,
and there were so few women! It wasn't until after about a month
of attending daily that I realized I wasn't that important--that
others in the rooms didn't care who I was, where I was coming
from, or what I had used. They only cared about me, as an addict
seeking recovery.
  I always arrived late and left before the Serenity Prayer at
the end. There was no way I was going to let anyone hug me,
let alone get to know me. And there was no way I was going to
pray to a God who, in my opinion, had never done anything
for me. I had prayed daily as a child--praying that God would
stop the abuse, praying that God would help my mother stop
drinking, praying that God would bring my daddy back to me.
Those prayers were never answered, so I wasn't about to pray
to God now.
  When I was about ten days clean I packed up and moved
across the country. I ended up in Seattle, where I had lived be-
fore. My first stop was at an ex-partner's house, knowing she
would have drugs. It had been a few years since I had seen her,
and she looked different. I told her I was hurting bad and needed
a fix. She looked at me and said she knew exactly where to get
what I needed. We headed off in her car to a large yellow house.
Imagine my surprise when I realized that she had brought me
to a recovery house, where meetings were held daily! It was a

    speaker meeting that night, and my ex was sharing her experi-
    ence, strength, and hope. She ended by suggesting to all new-
    comers that they find a home group, get a sponsor, and attend
    ninety meetings in ninety days.
      I looked around the room and saw a woman I could relate to. I
    figured she would make a good sponsor, so I asked her to spon-
    sor me. She told me she would, and we should get together to
    talk about it. That very night, she and two others got high and
    ended up in a car wreck. Those with her died instantly. She hung
    on. When I found out the next day at a meeting, I went to visit
    her in hospital. What I saw shocked me. She had lost her arms
    and legs in the crash. I looked down at her and thought, "This is
    my sponsor." She died the following day.
      When I was ninety days clean, I again packed up and moved to
    Portland, Oregon. There, the first person to greet me was a mili-
    tary police officer in recovery. After the meeting she invited me
    to join her and others for coffee. I was amazed at the fun we had
    that night. We laughed a lot, we talked about everything--not
    just about recovery--and I learned that there were many other
    single parents in the rooms. I was gifted with a Basic Text when
    my home group members realized I didn't have one. I attended
    meetings daily, bringing my children with me when necessary. I
    contributed to the Seventh, and I think I may have volunteered
    to do a reading--once.
      No one knew when my first anniversary came up because I
    never shared. My children were having a sleepover at a friend's
    house, so I attended a meeting that night, but turned down of-
    fers to go out for coffee. I had other plans. I went home and hung
    myself in my basement. The God I didn't want saw fit to have a
    flood take place in my home that night, and when the plumber
    arrived he found me hanging in the basement. I was immedi-
    ately cut down. I woke up in hospital several days later to find
    that woman from the meetings sitting by my bed.

   She was holding my hand and telling me to hang on, praying
to the God she loved to give me one more chance. Once I was
coherent enough to speak, she asked me if I had called my spon-
sor before trying to kill myself. I shook my head no and told her
I did not have a sponsor. Knowing I would never ask, she said,
"Well, you do now! I will temporary sponsor you until you can
find one."
   She ended up "temporary sponsoring" me for the next eight
years. That relationship ended only when her God called her
home. About six months after she began sponsoring me, I went
to make an amends. As I was driving along the highway, I found
myself talking out loud. This "Higher Power" stuff was heavy
on my mind, because I heard it every day at meetings. Having
been raised Catholic, I knew about miracles, and I asked that if
there was a God, I would be given some sign. I said this aloud.
Suddenly, the truck ahead of me lost its load. Bushels of potatoes
fell all over the highway. I parked my car and got out to help the
farmer. He was very grateful and offered me a bushel. I said,
"No, thank you--but can I have one potato?" He didn't know
why I wanted one, but said, "Sure!"
   When I got home I immediately called my sponsor. "I think
I found my Higher Power," I told her. She invited me to come
over to talk about it. I packed up my potato and walked into
her home. I held out my hand. She looked at the potato, looked
at me, and in her wisdom asked if it had a name. I told her its
name was Spud. She smiled at me and said, "How wonderful!
SPUD--Special Protection Under Direction!"
   The topic at the meeting that night was, of course, "Higher
Powered." I shared my experience. Nobody laughed at me.After
the meeting, I allowed members of our fellowship to hug me for
the first time. I began working the steps, and found myself get-
ting a cake and a keytag for the anniversary I had not celebrated.
Members also gave me many gifts--potato chips, a potato hat,
gift certificates for French fries, and bags of potatoes.

       It was during this time that Patrick came into my life. He at-
    tended many meetings but had been gone for some time. Every-
    one assumed he was out using. When he returned to the rooms,
    he was very thin and obviously unhealthy. He shared that he had
    spent months in hospital with AIDS-related complex, and that he
    was dying. I didn't know Patrick well, but he had shared that he
    had no family, and I had just enough recovery in me to know that
    no one need die alone when he is a member of NA. I reached out,
    offering to be on his care team. Patrick taught me a lot about liv-
    ing during the next four months. I held his hand while he took his
    last breath, and the fellowship made sure he had a decent funeral.
    Patrick showed me how to live and how to die clean.
       When I was two years clean, I was working my Ninth Step.
    I knew in order to continue recovering I had to get real honest
    with my sponsor, and then I had to surrender to police on old
    felony charges. In 1980 I had kidnapped my own children, at-
    tempting to protect them from further abuse by their father. I
    was wanted on a total of five felony charges as a result. My spon-
    sor didn't judge me. She only asked if I was sure I had to do this,
    and if I could handle the consequences. I didn't feel I had any
    other choice. I knew if I was going to recover I had to be willing
    to go to any lengths, and making amends was something I had
    to do.
       In order to surrender to police, I had to return to Canada.
    Standing in front of the judge brought back many memories for
    me. But this time I was clean and my prayers to God were not
    "Please keep me out of jail, I promise not to do this again!" Now
    I let go and asked God to decide what would be best. After a long
    trial, the jury found me guilty. I was facing a total of fifty years in
    prison. I knew it would be tough, but I also knew that members
    from hospitals and institutions committees would attend the
    prison, bringing messages of recovery inside, and that we could
    hold meetings of our own in prison. The judge, however, saw that
    I was in recovery and overturned four of the five guilty verdicts.

She sentenced me on only one charge, "harboring." At sentenc-
ing, she said she had no doubt that I felt the need to harbor my
children, and that I was in recovery, and had offered honest
information that I could well have denied. I ended up living in
Ottawa, Ontario, working in a shelter. There I reconnected with
my native roots and spirituality.
   I was seven years clean when I was raped and stabbed during
the Oka crisis. My doctor stitched me up and gave me an HIV
                 24

antibody test. The test came back negative. So did the next test
six months later. I found it extremely difficult to remain in Ot-
tawa after the attack, and moved to Rochester, New York, where
I had many friends in recovery. I knew they would help me deal
with this violence against me, and help me continue to recover.
   A month after I arrived in Rochester, a friend shared that she
was scared to go for her HIV test. I agreed to go with her. Her test
came back negative. Mine came back reactive. I asked the doc-
tor what this meant and he told me that I had HIV, and would
develop AIDS and die. I told no one. For six weeks I sat alone in
my apartment, not answering the phone or door, not attending
meetings. Even though I knew I had contracted HIV through
the rape, I was filled with shame. It felt like a bomb had been
dropped in my lap. I was terrified of what lay ahead, having seen
so many friends die from AIDS.
   I made the decision that rather than bring shame to my fam-
ily or hurt those in recovery who loved me, it would be better if
I died. I didn't want to use, so I went to a bridge. I was about to
jump when I felt my father's energy around me. I swear I could
even smell Brylcreem! I remembered the words he used to tell
me as a child: "If you ever doubt the love of your Creator, go hug
a tree!" Slowly I stepped off the bridge and made my way to an
old tree on the shore. I sat, hugging it, and cried. I attended a
meeting the next day and shared.
   About a year later I decided to return to Canada, hoping that
my illness would help to bring my dysfunctional family back

24In 1990, there was a three-month-long armed conflict between the
  Mohawk Nation of Kanesatake and the government of Quebec in

    together. I thought I needed to be near my children and my
    grandchildren. I soon learned that ongoing contact with my fam-
    ily would only keep me sick. Nothing was going to mess with
    my recovery. I decided that if God saw fit for me to have HIV, I
    was going to do Her or His will, and take care of me first. I also
    got training and became an AIDS educator. I traveled across
    the country doing AIDS prevention and education workshops,
    bringing the message of hope to those still stuck in the disease
    of addiction that it was not too late for them, that they could re-
    cover! It has been fifteen years since I was infected with HIV. This
    disease has taken its toll, but I did what was suggested. Most
    importantly, I did not use!
       It was not until a doctor told me that I was going to die that I
    truly began to live. Each day, I thank Creator for another day of
    life, another day of recovery, and ask what I can do to help some-
    one that day. Hopefully, sharing my story will help one addict
    find recovery.

      Neither the military nor prison nor hospitalization helped
      this Russian addict clean up until some members brought
   a meeting--and a Basic Text--to the hospital. Reading the book
     gave him the willingness to try the NA way. Now he's been
             clean and working the steps for five years.

Mosaic

Looking   back on my life to tell you this story, I can see that indi-
vidual situations that seemed to have no connection interweave
to become part of one picture, like a mosaic made whole from
small fragments.
  I grew up in a southern republic of the Soviet Union. I don't
remember any significant commotions in my childhood. My first
disappointments came from girls: I was short. One simply told
me: "First you have to get taller; then we might be friends." I
thought I had to prove my adequacy. Constant street fights and
conflicts with my teachers and parents made life pretty extreme.
Feelings were too much for me. My scandalous reputation led
me to bad company, where drugs and crime were used as medi-
cation to avoid reality.
  By the time I was eighteen, my addiction was obvious. I tried
repeatedly to solve the problem with medical help, without suc-
cess. Military service was compulsory, but those who had health
problems, including active addiction, could have an exemption.
I willingly went into the army because I thought that it would
solve my problems with the law and drugs. I met other addicts,
and they told me where I could find drugs. My service became
the endless search for drugs and money. I gathered opium in the
poppy fields and stole money in town. In the fall there was no
opium in the fields; in desperation I robbed a pharmacy and was
caught by the police.
  At twenty-six I was released from jail for the second time.
Major changes had happened while I was imprisoned. The


                                 341

    Soviet Union had fallen apart, and my parents had moved away
    to Russia. It was clear that I had to change too, as soon as pos-
    sible. My relatives tried to help me. I was baptized and moved
    as well, but neither religion nor geographical changes solved
    my problems. The new town was only fifty years old, and living
    there, I was depressed and melancholy. I felt like I was forever
    separated from my motherland and my friends. I met a girl,
    and I devoted myself completely to her. When she left I could
    not overcome the pain. Again my life became a vicious circle of
    crime and using.
      I ended up with another jail sentence. After that there was an-
    other try to start my life over again. But I woke up in intensive
    care, hooked up to a ventilator, and understood that I had been
    in a coma after another overdose. As soon as I was discharged
    from the hospital I was back on the streets, looking for drugs
    and money. My interrogating officer let me go until sentencing
    under the pledge not to leave town. My first thought was to go
    into hiding, but the life I was leading wasn't worth such effort.
    I was calm when I went to court, and I received a surprisingly
    brief sentence.
      I continued to use in prison until I realized that I hadn't will-
    ingly surrendered to the authorities just to get high. That night
    I collected all the drugs I had left, and threw everything away. I
    made a firm decision to quit using. I had my first sincere prayer
    experience. I was not religious, but in my own words, I asked God
    to help me. I was ashamed to ask to be rescued from the results of
    my own actions. I believed that many people who suffered from
    my actions needed God's help much more than me. I asked God
    to help all people to solve their problems. Soon I was paroled.
      I was shocked when I started using the first day I was released.
    It started with one drink. I reached my bottom within four
    months. I got so scared that I stopped again.
      I met an old friend, and she invited me to go to Narcotics
    Anonymous with her. The girl was pretty, so I said yes. I was not

                                                    Life on Life's Terms 343


impressed by the meeting. When the secretary announced the
First Step as the topic, I was surprised. I thought they were all
still on the First Step. I didn't realize that this topic was for me.
I was sure that my clean time was the result of my willpower. I
stopped going to meetings, and soon I was back to using.
   My next treatment was not easy. The doctors thought I was
incurable. I was totally discouraged. One day I was talking with
another patient about Narcotics Anonymous, when some of the
people I saw at my first NA meeting came in. They were full of
energy and sincerely tried to help. At that time the NA Fellow-
ship in my city was just seven months old. There was only one
copy of the Basic Text, and they left it for us in the hospital. I
read it almost from cover to cover. The visit from NA members
and reading the book had an effect on me. I started to work my
First Step.
   I wrote down the most vivid evidence of serious problems,
but when the time came to acknowledge my powerlessness and
unmanageability I flatly refused to write about it, thinking that
it was absolute nonsense. I asked everybody to explain why the
step was worded this way; maybe it was a mistake. Explanations
didn't help until I realized that all my life I had dreamt of being
healthy, rich, living in a beautiful house in the city. I dreamt of
love, and always wanted to be sophisticated. But in fact I had ru-
ined health, a criminal record, and social instability, and at that
moment I was in a hospital of a certain kind, which speaks for
itself. It was the first time I could see the difference between my
dreams and reality. What I learned stunned me. I gave up: All my
attempts to control my condition had been worthless.
   My First Step helped me face my fears. I started attending NA
meetings regularly. I didn't have any more problems recognizing
my powerlessness and insanity. It was the right time to ask for
help. I tried to apply everything I heard in meetings. Besides go-
ing to meetings every day, I wrote my steps, talked with my spon-
sor, shared honestly, and analyzed my day and my feelings in the

344 Narcotics Anonymous


    evening. It worked: My life started to change. Most surprising
    was the way I felt. I gained confidence and inner strength, back-
    bone. Those principles that I heard in meetings were beyond
    doubt for me.
      The Third Step confused me. I needed to turn my will and life
    over to the care of God? I thought I could never achieve such
    readiness and faith. I talked about it with other NA members.
    Not saying a word about religion, they shared about God, love,
    and the perspective that emerges in the Third Step. I couldn't
    understand what they were telling me. I wrote about it, attended
    meetings, and thought a lot about the concept of turning my life
    over to the care of God.
      Meanwhile, I got into a conflict involving a girl I had feelings
    for and another person. I was ready to take drastic action to solve
    the conflict. Instead, I decided to trust my God--and waited
    for the results with great interest. My relations with my friends
    didn't revive, and the girl stopped talking to me, but I experi-
    enced amazing tranquility. I found out that I am able to be above
    my impulses and live without doing harm to myself or people
    around me. The experience taught me to be honest in seeking my
    goals and leave the results in God's hands.
      My home group was pretty young, and sometimes we had
    meetings with only two people present. When we had questions,
    we called other cities. I attended conventions of neighboring NA
    communities. The group grew a little, and then there were a se-
    ries of relapses and again the group became really small. I had
    been close to those who relapsed. I couldn't understand why it
    happened. If there are no guarantees, what's the point of recov-
    ery? I was not satisfied with the answers I heard. I was depressed
    for weeks.
      One day, sitting by myself in a meeting room, I noticed that
    the walls were covered with scraps of paper, and that nobody
    had cleaned the floor for a while. The books we used were in
    poor condition, and some of the literature wasn't related to our

                                                   Life on Life's Terms 345


fellowship. I thought that I had found a reason for relapses.
People didn't get what they came here for, because we were not
ready to give it to them. I started coming earlier to clean the floor.
For decoration I chose key phrases from our literature. My need
to understand why the development of the group slowed down
pushed me into studying the traditions.
   I started to understand that my service was not only for my
friends. There are those who don't have the opportunity for a
change, and we can give them this chance. Reading about the
creation of the Basic Text, I learned principles of service. The
words "with Gratitude, Love and Dedication" were a call for
action.
   Understanding the necessity of personal recovery, I continued
working the steps.Afraid of the Fourth Step, I took precautions. I
ordered a small wooden box, cut a furniture lock into it, kept my
notebook with the inventory in that box, and carried the key all
the time. The Fourth Step allowed me to see the true reasons for
my actions, which were not always pleasant. Sometimes, when I
analyzed yet another resentment that was so similar to the previ-
ous ones that it hurt, I started to lose the point of what I was do-
ing. But trust in my Higher Power and the program helped me to
move forward. From experience I knew that pauses in working
the steps can be dangerous. I knew I had to write regularly, even
if in small portions, but to write.
   When I was working the Fourth Step, I started looking for
someone to work the Fifth Step with. I asked God for help, and
my prayers were heard. A person I recognized from another
city's group anniversary came to our group anniversary. He
shared his experience of the Sixth Step.After I described my situ-
ation to him, he shared his experience of working Steps Four and
Five and we made a plan to meet. My new sponsor listened to me
the whole night. When I was done reading the last page, he said
that he understood my feelings and shared about similar situa-
tions that he had had. Nevertheless, he noted that in his opinion

346 Narcotics Anonymous


    I was not thorough enough in one area. He recommended that I
    study and write some more.
       To start writing again I needed to overcome my fear of my
    listener's opinion. I came to understand that confession to myself
    and God is not any less important than sharing with another per-
    son, and that person suffered because of my fear of being misun-
    derstood. Our next meeting was very productive. He asked me:
    "What are your feelings from the work you have done?" I said,
    "I am not just a drug addict. I have an addictive personality. My
    sexual life has the same symptoms of addiction as when I used
    drugs."
       While working the Sixth Step I practiced such principles as
    self-acceptance and honest recognition of the character defects
    that were the core of any conflict--internal or external. Under-
    standing the need to move forward, I started the Seventh Step. I
    was sure that I was "entirely ready," but I didn't notice changes
    in my behavior and thinking. I realized that my desire to get rid
    of the character defects expressed in words on paper did not al-
    ways have agreement in my heart. I went back to the Sixth Step
    and then worked the Seventh Step again. I needed more than
    a year to understand the choices made in Steps Six and Seven.
    These discoveries were the beginning of a new relationship with
    God.
       Now, in the fifth year of my clean life, I understand that it is
    necessary to take responsibility for my actions. The Eighth Step,
    no matter how much I want to delay it, is a landmark in my re-
    covery, proving that I am on the right track.
       Sometimes I have moments in my recovery when it seems that
    all my efforts are in vain. Reality makes me despair, the words of
    my friends don't comfort, meetings seem annoying, and prayer
    is not sincere. In such situations I just try to live through the
    feelings. And life goes on: People trust me, professional activi-
    ties bring satisfaction, new perspectives appear, and love comes
    with time.

   My recovery is not just a series of senseless coincidences.
Whether I am engaged in service on a committee, or practicing
the Twelfth Step, or simply living the program, I find values
inside myself which would be impossible to replace with some-
thing external. My life is a mosaic, and Narcotics Anonymous
is the structure and foundation of that mosaic. Each time I look
at my life I see more pieces being added to that mosaic, and a
bigger picture becomes visible--as well as the greatness of the
one who has made beauty from broken pieces: the God of my
understanding.

Family Disease, Family Recovery

With   ten years clean I was facing a crisis in my family. Living
the program of Narcotics Anonymous had given me the tools
to create a good life for myself and my children. I wanted them
to participate in their lives and thrive. But despite all my efforts
and attention, the counseling and consequences, my two teenage
boys were out of control with their use of drugs. I was at a loss
as to how to help them.
  Raising two boys is challenging in any case, but when I had
one son under two and was pregnant with our second boy, I
came home one day to find my husband dead of an overdose.
My life was painful and exhausting, but I put my head down,
held my boys close, and pressed on. The effects of my husband's
death can still sneak up on me in surprising ways--grief wash-
ing over me as I get a scent of his cologne while leafing through
a magazine, or when I realize the only memories our boys have
of him are stories and pictures.
  A few years after his death, I could no longer hold down the
grief on my own. My long history of casual using rose to a new,
unmanageable level. A year later I gave up on my career and
quickly deteriorated--mind, body, and spirit. I did not lose my
home or my children, but I lost my enthusiasm, my compassion,
and my energy.
  I was not able to emotionally connect with my boys, so I
brought in a mentor and caregiver to take care of their physical
needs. He proved to be my family's angel. He fed and dressed
my young boys when I was debilitated, combed their hair, and
took them to day care and school. He became the one person
they could count on. Then he became part of the solution to my

                                348

real problem: He was involved when my family held an inter-
vention for me. I went to treatment, and while my family cared
for my children out of state, he wrote to the boys every day. He
remains a part of our family, living in our home and mentoring
the boys, a vital part of our lives.
  I first heard of NA in treatment, and I doubted that it could
be the answer for me. I became involved with Narcotics Anony-
mous reluctantly. I did not join groups, I did not know how to
ask for help, I did not have a higher power or want to find one,
and I did not get along well with other women. Growing up
in the home I did taught me to be independent and to hide my
feelings. But I continued to go to meetings, and I was eventually
able to hear the message. I finally got a sponsor, and she sug-
gested I get to know some women, get a service position, and
start working steps. This was the beginning of real recovery for
me. The women in the program have shown me how to love and
be loved, how to ask for help, how to be of service in all areas of
my life, how to find my higher power in everything, and how to
experience joy in my everyday life.
  I began living my life in recovery. Our home was filled with
people from the fellowship. My friends in NA were in my life on
a daily basis. My service commitments kept me involved, and I
secured my place as a member of the NA community. I attended
lots of meetings and felt like a good example of a person living
recovery.
  Unfortunately, I was living with the mistaken belief that by
being a "good enough" recovering addict, I could shield my
children from ever experiencing active addiction. Having lost
my husband and both parents to the disease of addiction, I com-
mitted myself to ending the cycle of addiction with my own re-
covery. I intended to protect my children from active addiction.
This, however, was beyond my control.
  It seemed our lives were always in chaos. Whenever the phone
rang, I cringed and wondered what crisis awaited. I spent my

350 Narcotics Anonymous


    days trying to keep track of where they were and who they were
    with, hoping to ward off trouble. I spoke to teachers, counselors,
    mentors, parents, my sponsor, and friends in recovery. Always
    one to paint a rosy picture, I acted like things were okay. I tried
    to minimize, justify, and deny that things were as bad as they
    were. I practiced "magical thinking," telling myself that every-
    thing would work itself out. The reality was that my children
    were both sinking.
       It was in my power to be there to help them when they were
    ready to be helped. At fifteen, my youngest son made a resolu-
    tion to quit using. I promised to help him if he was unable to do
    it alone. When he couldn't stay clean by himself, we took him to
    an adolescent treatment center. I didn't know if there was any
    way to help my seventeen-year-old, and in some ways I had giv-
    en up on him. Family therapy was one of the treatment center's
    primary components, and we all attended the sessions together.
    I began to regain some hope. We continued the counseling, each
    of us individually and our family as a whole, and began to un-
    ravel the unhealthy behaviors that led to our turmoil.
       All the while, I prayed and worked steps. I went to meetings,
    tended to my service commitments, and stayed close to my com-
    munity. I looked to the people in NA who had been through
    similar experiences. I got the message, again and again, that
    my children have a higher power too, and that our lives are un-
    folding perfectly. It didn't feel like it as I watched my elder son
    struggle with his commitment to stay clean for the sake of his
    little brother. When my younger son completed the treatment
    program, we all went to pick him up. We left his older brother
    there in his place. We continued on the path we had begun with
    ongoing family therapy.
       We are among the many who have found the way to Narcotics
    Anonymous by various paths, and I am present to the miracles
    that brought us here. The important thing is that we are here,
    and we are all in recovery now. We have had to learn how to be

                                                  Life on Life's Terms 351


supportive of each other while maintaining separate programs.
Our family is on a different path, and we have new ways of re-
lating to one another. It is not always easy, but it is always better
than what we knew in active addiction.
  For many years I have been grateful to Narcotics Anonymous
for what it has done in my life. Now, as I see the love of the fel-
lowship surround my sons, I am grateful beyond measure.

Enough

With    all that I had left in me, I cried out, "Enough!" I couldn't
count the number of times I had said that. I sincerely didn't
want to use any longer. Yet I reached toward the table, toward
the very cause of my pain. I hadn't willed this action, yet there I
was, reaching for another fix. "No!" my words echoed, but I was
alone. I heard a faint voice: "Do you want to live, or die?" I sat
there looking down at my seemingly endless supply of destruc-
tion. I wondered if I had finally lost my mind: Had I actually
heard death's ultimatum? Had God spoken? I felt an abrupt shift.
My spirit, with what must have been its last ounce of strength,
dragged me battered and beaten toward life. Memories of empty
promises flooded into me, of all the people I had let down, and
all of those I had hurt. I had truly hoped it would be different this
time. I stared at the clock and prayed for God to help me. Finally,
at 6:30 am, I reached for the phone.
  That was over seven years ago. I was introduced to Narcotics
Anonymous through hospitals and institutions meetings while I
was a resident of the local detox facility. I had a short relapse af-
ter five and a half months clean. After that I got clean and began
working the steps, got involved in service, stayed in contact with
my sponsor, and began to apply my recovery. After returning to
school in order to pursue a career, I moved to a nearby city and
found a job that I love and still work at today. From the begin-
ning of my recovery I began to have feelings of belonging, hope,
and peace. I remain extremely grateful for the life NAhas helped
me to develop. Gone are the endless days of desperation, loneli-
ness, despair, and shame.

  When I had a few years clean, after a relationship failed, my
sponsor prompted me to begin addressing relationship issues
through step work. I started to see a pattern in the kinds of diffi-
culties I had in relationships with women. I began to understand
the reasons I pursued unfulfilling relationships: This allowed me
to focus blame outward, rather than look at myself. Yet instead
of facing these issues, I started another relationship with another
woman in recovery before finishing the previous one. I was will-
ing to look at my pattern of pursuing women in order to feel val-
ued, but I brushed off the persistent tap on my shoulder telling
me I should examine the role sex played in my life.
  During this latest relationship I was still secretly acting out
sexually, rationalizing and justifying these behaviors to myself,
using my clean time as a defense against the rising tide of guilt.
Asteady, secret shame was growing inside. Sex allowed me, for a
brief time, to feel wanted and desired. After I had acted out, once
the pleasure subsided, shame would again set in. I still wasn't
talking about this.
  When my girlfriend said that my addiction was running ram-
pant, I would resist, blame, derail, rationalize, and then begin
rambling about freedom of self-expression, topping all of my
defenses with justification. I would act out again, with the same
result: temporary pleasure followed by nagging guilt I tried to
ignore. Slowly, each sexual fix created a tolerance that required a
larger "hit" to create the same experience of escape. At the time,
I did not see the similarity between this and my drug use. My
defenses and secrecy kept me blind to my behavior. Inevitably, I
began to think about how drugs could add to my sexual experi-
ence. At first this thought tempted and appealed to me, and then
I disregarded it as an annoyance. The day I brushed aside the
devastating power of addiction, I became a conscious contribu-
tor to my disease.
  One night, while I was again out cruising the local drag, I
started to look out for a dealer. This time the thought was any-

354 Narcotics Anonymous


    thing but subtle. A craving to use drugs hit me with a deadly
    force, a force I had forgotten. It was as if I went on a brief mental
    vacation. I could still sort of see myself as I was, but it was like I
    was an observer of my own actions. I saw a parked ambulance,
    and the attendants were loading someone into the back. The
    thought occurred to me that this was probably related to addic-
    tion, an overdose perhaps. As I continued to drive, I noticed four
    police officers walking the beat. Then, as if a missing part of me
    had returned, I found myself feeling shocked and afraid, ques-
    tioning what I was doing in this area of town. I headed straight
    home.
      As soon as I got home I went to bed. Old tapes began looping
    in my head: "What's the matter with you?" "You're sick!" "What
    were you thinking?" "Don't tell anyone." "Just give up." I felt
    alone, worthless, hopeless, and desperate. I ached for relief. I
    prayed for help, and through my prayers I began to understand
    what I needed to do.
      The next day I connected with another NAmember, a sponsee.
    In spite of my fears, I told my friend about the events of the night
    before, and about my secrets. He shed genuine tears of concern,
    and I felt accepted, understood, and unconditionally loved. In
    spite of my shame I made a commitment with him to attend a
    meeting that evening. I stayed close to him all day, attended the
    meeting, and then made a commitment to connect with him the
    next day as well. I went to a meeting in the morning and shared
    directly about my recent experience, and exposed the dark se-
    crets of my shame to the light of recovery before a group of
    men. I cried. After this meeting I stopped at my sponsor's home
    and began the process by getting honest with him. Several men
    in recovery called me on a regular basis expressing their love,
    concern, and encouragement. One day I arrived at a meeting
    and realized that I had not made a commitment to anyone to at-
    tend that meeting. For the first time since nearly using, I was at
    a meeting for myself.

                                                Life on Life's Terms 355


   Soon I got honest with my girlfriend. I acknowledged my be-
havior and validated her concerns. In talking about my secrets,
I took the first steps toward changing my behavior. Today I am
admitting my addictive behavior and working this out through
the steps. One thing I've learned from this is that the feedback
I get from those closest to me and how I react to it are a direct
indication of where I am in my recovery. We are each other's
eyes and ears, and building relationships with other addicts in
NarcoticsAnonymous gives me the support I need to face myself
and grow in my recovery.
   During much of my recovery I have stayed involved in service,
attended meetings regularly, joined and completed step groups,
and formed relationships with other addicts in the program.
And I have prayed. As a result, I had a huge support system in
place to help me when I needed it the most. It's one thing to ap-
ply this program when I want to stay clean, and another thing
altogether to apply this program when I want to use again. This
is how the program works for me.
   I believe that the night I was out cruising, my loving Higher
Power kept me safe. The work I had done in my earlier recovery
laid the foundation for me to build a deeper and more meaning-
ful program of recovery today. I now understand that I can talk
clean and live dirty. I've had enough. Today I not only want to be
clean from drugs, I want to live clean.

It Is Worth It

When     I was a child, my older brother had mental health prob-
lems which everyone said were caused by his drug use. I felt
ashamed that other kids knew he was my brother. I was scared
of drugs, but instead of rejecting them, I felt attracted to them.
Besides the physical sensations, I felt like I belonged to a parche; I
felt older. I believed I could control my drug use; my brother's
            25

psychiatric problems wouldn't happen to me.
   As a teenager I was increasingly involved with drugs. I was
lazy and irresponsible; my only interest was to use drugs and to
hang around the street corners of my barrio. I felt more intelli-
                                                  26

gent than everyone else. I dreamed that I would get so rich that
I could use drugs without affecting anyone else, without anyone
else bothering me, without having to work. I wanted to enjoy
life, and the only way I could imagine that was by using and
by acquiring material possessions. My dream was to become a
member of the mafia so I could own everything I ever wanted.
In reality, I was too cowardly to risk becoming a trafficker; I was
afraid that I would end up in jail or be killed.
   When I was eighteen, I went camping with friends along the
Bizcocho River, and the police arrested us with a pretty large
supply of drugs. I went to jail for the first time, and my life
changed dramatically. For the first time I experienced starvation
and being deprived of my freedom. But drugs were always a
relief, an escape. After I got out of jail, the judge issued another
warrant for my arrest and I ran away. I thought it was cruel that
the police chased me just because I enjoyed using. I didn't think

I was harming anyone--I didn't even realize that I was harming
myself. Drugs separated me from my family, my studies, my
neighborhood, and my friends. I felt that this was just my fate; I
didn't question my drug use at all.
   Looking for a way out of this legal mess, I volunteered to
serve in the Colombian navy. My family hoped that military
discipline would change my ways. My ego took a blow when
they cut my hair and made me wear a uniform. I was a number,
a rifle, a toy that marched, but inside I was still a dreamer who
felt different and more intelligent than other people. With drugs
I escaped, and I could find people who were like me; life seemed
less hard.
   A month before I finished military service, one of my friends
told me that he wanted to stop using. We talked about it and
planned to quit--after we got out of the navy. Two days later,
he committed suicide. It affected me so deeply that for the first
time I consciously decided to stop using. I began to think that I
wanted a normal life, without drugs. I stopped using with great
difficulty, and when I returned home a month later I felt like a
different person. I slept in a clean room, alone, after such a long
time! To be able to take a bath and eat Mom's frisoles felt like
heaven. My family got me a job, and I thought that the night-
         27

mare was over.
   But addiction had other plans for me.Anew substance arrived
in my life, and it was love at first sight. Things changed. I had a
constant need to use. I felt desperate when I ran out. This drug
cost a lot more money than I was earning, and I began to steal at
home and from work. I lost my job and my family again. When
I used drugs I always lost something. This time I didn't share
drugs like I did before. I just hung around other people until
they gave me some, and then I would leave and use alone.
   Soon the drug didn't give me any pleasure; instead I got per-
manent pain: anguish when I didn't have any more, fear, para-
noia, guilt, lies. I walked the streets alone until dawn, ashamed

27Frisoles are a popular regional dish.

    that people would see me asking for money in the streets, willing
    to do anything so I could get high. I wanted to stop using but I
    didn't know how. All my attempts and promises failed.
       My father passed away and I returned home, but everything
    was much worse. I felt guilty and empty. I was using more and
    more, and I wanted to die. Finally my mother knelt down in
    desperation, and as she cried she handed me a knife. She asked
    me to kill her once and for all, not little by little like I had been
    doing. My brothers threw me down the stairs and out of the
    house, and I went out into the street, intending to commit suicide
    by throwing myself in front of a car. This was the darkest day of
    my life. I hit bottom, and looking for help, I arrived at NA.
       When I got to NA, the fellowship was just beginning in my
    country. There were three people with very little clean time and
    no literature who gathered in a room in a church twice a week. I
    didn't understand much in this meeting, but I felt that they were
    people like me who had suffered because of their drug use and
    who wanted to help me unconditionally. For the first time I felt
    hope: If they could do it, why couldn't I?
       What helped the most in the beginning was learning that I suf-
    fered from a disease and that I could recover if I wanted to. The
    only thing I needed to get started was not to use that first dose,
    no matter what happened, just for today. I was not alone--these
    people would help me. The next day one of the group members
    called to find out how I was, and he invited me to a new meeting.
    I wanted to stay clean with all my heart. I only left the house to
    attend meetings. My only priority was to stop using. I began to
    feel that recovery was possible, and I began to live the miracle of
    not having to use.
       My experience had shown me my powerlessness. But little by
    little I began to discover that my life was unmanageable. I was
    filled with guilt. I was afraid of having to face life, of assuming
    responsibilities. I believed that the world should reward me for
    staying clean. The group taught me that stopping using was not

                                                 Life on Life's Terms 359


the total goal. I began to believe that the Power that was freeing
me from the obsession to use could also help me to change.
   I began to ask God to transform my life, and a powerful desire
tobeofservicewasborninme.Ihadnotyetworkedonmydefects
of character; I still allowed my impulses to run my life, but I felt
an enormous need to give, and began to serve with the conviction
that it was God's will for my life. I desperately wanted other
addicts to have the opportunity to know the program. There was
a lot to do. Almost no one knew that we existed; we didn't have
literature or a structure. There were only two meetings in the
whole country. When we worked in unity, the groups began to
grow and multiply. Sometime later we contacted world services
and we discovered that we were not alone, and that there was
help available. When we received the first translations of the NA
steps we were able to acquire our own identity as a fellowship.
The message gained more power with the literature, and more
addicts were able to identify with us and stop using.
   Thanks to my Higher Power I kept coming back, and I've wit-
nessed miracles. I've seen those four initial members become
hundreds, and from that one little group, the only one we had
in Colombia, grew more than 80 groups providing 300 weekly
meetings. Our first contacts with NA members in other cities in
Colombia and from other countries brought us indescribable
joy. We'd share translations and literature, and hope the message
would take root. When Colombia hosted the world convention,
we truly felt that we belonged to a universal fellowship.
   My recovery has always been tied to service. In the beginning,
my responsibilities made me feel that I wasn't useless; my life
had meaning. On occasion, being responsible for opening the
meeting kept me from using.
   There has also been difficulty in service, but from that diffi-
culty I learned to listen to my heart. In the beginning the group
followed the Second Tradition; then the group started to become
an extension of the leader's personality. It was very painful and
confusing; I had to choose between loyalty to my sponsor and

360 Narcotics Anonymous


    the principles of the program. Should I keep quiet to maintain
    unity, or express my conscience as I had been taught? We lost
    many members, but with the help of the literature and members
    outside the region, the few of us who remained were able to
    move forward in harmony with our principles, and once more
    we grew.
      Sponsorship has taught me to commit to the steps and to trust
    the process. Working the steps helped me to discover a person
    who I don't want to be any longer, and to develop a vision of the
    person who I aspire to be. Today I really believe that God wants
    me to stay clean and be happy; to give and receive love; to live
    here and now, accepting life on life's terms; and to change my
    old way of reacting when things don't turn out as I had hoped. I
    have developed a relationship with my Higher Power which has
    opened my mind, so I can better relate to myself and others. I am
    learning to forgive others and to forgive myself. I experience the
    miracle every day I stay clean and when I do what I have to do
    with joy. I don't have to look for happiness anymore. If I follow
    this path, my life is destined to be more serene and happy.
      This program has become a way of life for me. I have the
    freedom to choose according to principles. I know that I am
    not alone. I have a lot of gratitude, and I express it by being of
    service. It was worth going through all the horrors of active ad-
    diction so I could participate in the development of NA here in
    Colombia. From my heart I want to continue as a member of NA
    for the rest of my life, because I cannot find a better place on the
    planet.
      When I first heard that recovery was a lifelong task, it seemed
    like too much. It seemed impossible to think that I would always
    have to work this program. Twenty years later this is what I like
    the most: to know that it never ends, that I will always have a
    place in NA, that I will never stop learning.

Becoming Whole

Hi.   I'm an addict and my name is.... I say I'm an addict first
because if I don't remember what I am, it won't matter who I
am. Today was a good day at work. For a person who was once
on Social Security disability living in government housing, this
is truly a miracle of recovery. Now I work with people who, like
me, have been diagnosed with major mental health disorders.
   When other counselors at work talk about their clients, I think,
"If they only knew I used to have all of those symptoms and I've
used all of those drugs." On a low-self-esteem day, sometimes I
still feel so transparent, as though others can see right through
me and they are just tolerating my existence as some sort of pet
project. The good news is that those days pass. Sub-zero self-
esteem used to be a way of life for me.
   When I first came into recovery I tried it with no medication
and just meetings--with no God, no sponsor, and no steps. At
ninety days clean, I went home the day after a vicious fight with
my using husband to find him dead. I continued to go to meet-
ings, but working the program my way and with no medications
drove me, eleven months later, to a full psychotic breakdown and
another suicide attempt clean. It was painful to learn that I am
powerless over life and death. My attempt did not kill me--nor
did it stop the incessant psychotic thoughts that I experienced. I
thought people could read my mind and were putting thoughts
into it. I even had a notion I had been captured by aliens during
a hostile takeover and you guys in the meeting were part of the
conspiracy.
   I was so sick, not just with addiction, but with another dis-
ease called schizophrenia. I had been diagnosed many times


                                  361

    with many different types of schizophrenia, including paranoid
    schizophrenia.After several more months of torture in my mind,
    in which I lived horrors still unbelievable to me to this day, I fi-
    nally turned myself in to a psychiatric ward, where I got stabi-
    lized on some medication. How wonderful that I was no longer
    agonizing, trying to not hear the voices. I got some relief through
    psychotropic medication.
      Shortly after that last hospitalization my father died. I believe
    he knew that finally I would be taken care of. I had started doing
    all of the basics in NAand have never stopped doing them. Plus,
    though I had formerly been a devout atheist, I became a spiritual
    explorer of sorts, trying all faiths on for size. The suggestions I
    heard from the fellowship at meetings helped me to develop a
    positive working relationship with a Higher Power. I stayed on
    my medication for about a year and a half while I learned some
    new tools. I had lots of outside help and was finally authorized
    by my doctor to try to live without the medication and to have
    regular checkups, which I have been doing ever since.
      Oneofthemajorthemesinmylifeismysearchforfamily.Iwas
    an only child and never bonded with my mother. I was always
    given mixed messages and felt damned if I did and damned if I
    didn't. I was taught that kids were seen but not heard. I lost my
    innocence when I was very young. By the time I was thirteen I
    was using every day as well as bingeing and purging. Since I had
    not been validated when I was growing up, I felt visible to the
    eye, but not to the heart. My life before Narcotics Anonymous
    was loveless and lawless.
      A lot of my sick behaviors were unhealthy ways to try to re-
    capture the innocence that I lost and to create family. I wanted a
    new family that would be there whenever I needed them, who
    would love me unconditionally. When I made abandonment and
    loss my "lower power," I relived my youth in dysfunctional re-
    lationships, returning to the source of my pain for comfort again
    and again.

  I have come to understand that in NAI am in a large extended
family where I don't get mixed messages. Thank goodness it's a
simple program. In NA I find the clarity and direction I have al-
ways sought. Thank God for the simple spiritual messages and
collective wisdom found in NA. At home the rules had always
changed. Reassuringly, these simple spiritual principles never
change.
  Narcotics Anonymous has helped me arrest my disease on a
daily basis. I have not used, binged, purged, or self-mutilated for
the fifteen years I have been in NA. I have not, since that early
suicide attempt, heard any voices. I have had lots of outside help
to deal with my mental health issues, but I address the residual
symptoms of my disease through recovery. The times when I
have felt suicidal, I haven't acted on those urges. At those times I
tell myself maybe in the future, but not today, and then the feel-
ings and desire pass. Suicide is a permanent solution for a tem-
porary problem. The Fifth Tradition leaves me never purposeless
and never alone; as a group member I can always carry the mes-
sage of recovery to the addict who still suffers.
  I have learned in NA to feel my feelings and become an inte-
grated, whole human being. Today I know that the consequences
of not feeling are much worse than the consequences of feeling.
My feelings are there for a reason. They are not just there to tor-
ment me to extremes. When I am attentive and mindful, I can see
what they are telling me. Then I don't have to make emotional
decisions, reacting to or running from the pain and fear. I own it,
and then let go and let God.
  I was dumped recently, and instead of dwelling on the rejec-
tion, I took inventory. I shared and shared. Tired and abandoned,
I deepened my surrender, and felt God's grace and love fill me up
more than ever before. I know that for me to live I must give and
forgive--give back what was so freely given to me; forgive and
not hold onto my patterns of victimization in relationships. I have
relationships today that are grounded in respect and equality.

364 Narcotics Anonymous


    I have learned in NA that the more I let go, the freer I am, and
    when I do this in relationships I am finally able to give and re-
    ceive unconditional love.
       With the help of others and the steps, staying teachable and
    reachable, I am not afraid. I have a strength that is not my own.
    The steps have helped me become an empowered woman. I have
    learned that my story is continually unfolding, with each day be-
    ing a few pages in the book. Knowing that more will be revealed
    excites me: Each day is a mystery in my Higher Power's hands.
    My human experience is not always my disease, and I don't have
    to blame my disease for every human experience. There is no
    shame in living today. I have the right to be happy, sad, fallible,
    joyful, ignorant, stupid at times, in debt or out, dumped by a guy
    or happy together, and so many other things.
       Earlier in my recovery somebody told me to keep a miracles
    diary. I see so many coincidences and miracles each day that I
    cannot deny the value of my life anymore. So I would like to
    reach out and say, don't quit before the miracle happens. Life on
    life's terms is rich with miracles.

   A string of "coincidences" led this addict to find a sponsor and
      to see that our acts of service can have far-reaching effects.

The Good We Do

Sometimes     I get the distinct feeling that I'm exactly where I'm
supposed to be, that people are put in my life for a reason, and
that coincidences are, well, not coincidences at all. Our actions
have consequences we can't always see. We'll never know how
our small efforts will reverberate through the world. Sometimes
the smallest selfless act takes on a life of its own and makes a dif-
ference in the lives of countless other people.
  After winding up in a treatment center in my hometown, I
went into a halfway house about a thousand miles away. By
the time I left the halfway house, I was a part of the local NA
community and had a job, so I stayed. When I was close to four
years clean, I returned to the city I'd grown up in. I had recently
lost my sponsor, and knew that I needed a new one to help me
through all the stresses and changes of relocation. As luck would
have it, an NA convention was being held a few miles away one
week after I relocated. I went to the convention hoping to meet
new people and perhaps find a sponsor.
  I didn't know anyone there, felt very alone, and wasn't having
a good time. But I stayed, remembering that my purpose at this
convention was to find a new sponsor, even if I felt alienated.
I'd been clean long enough to know that recovery sometimes
requires doing things I don't like to do, such as getting to know
new people even if I feel too scared to talk to them. Sometimes I
just need to do a little bit of footwork, face a little fear, and hope
for the best.
  My first few years clean had also shown me that those mem-
bers who are committed to service in NA are often people who
have strong recovery, so I went to workshops on the Twelve
Traditions. At the workshop on Traditions Ten through Twelve,


                                   365

    the second speaker introduced himself as Jim. He had a lot of
    good things to say; he also seemed vaguely familiar. As I lis-
    tened, it dawned on me that this might be the same person who
    had brought a meeting into the treatment center I'd been in. My
    memories of those first few days clean were fuzzy, so I wasn't
    sure if he was the guy from four years earlier.
      After the meeting, I approached him. This was intimidating:
    He had a lot of clean time, and was already talking to a bunch of
    other people. I asked if he had brought a meeting into the treat-
    ment center I'd been in about four years earlier. He said yes, and
    after four years, I had an opportunity to thank the nameless guy
    who'd first carried the message to me. I told him that he was the
    one who'd introduced me to NA, that the hospitals and institu-
    tions meeting he'd spoken at had made a profound impression
    on me and helped me to grasp the First Step, and that I'd been
    living clean, a thousand miles away, for the past four years.
      Though I hardly knew him, I trusted that we'd been brought
    together for a reason, and asked him to sponsor me. "I'd be hon-
    ored," he replied. He invited me to join him and some friends
    for dinner. The more we talked, the more confident I became
    in my choice of a sponsor. He sponsored me for the next eight
    years, and served as a model for me in many areas of my life; we
    remain close today. What were the odds of me running into this
    man during my first week home, out of several thousand recov-
    ering addicts in the region? How did I wind up in a workshop
    where he was the speaker? Why was the convention so conve-
    niently held just a few days after I relocated? In a flash, I saw the
    string of coincidences that led up to this moment.
      It occurred to me then that we never know the good we do. One
    act of service can make a profound difference, and one addict's
    good work can ripple outward in ways we can't foresee. There's
    something magical about that for me, something that helps
    me to continue to believe in a power greater than myself. He
    didn't know I'd stayed clean, had become a responsible member

of society, and had been carrying the message into hospitals and
institutions myself; I was just one of many addicts he spoke to in
the course of a year-long weekly service commitment four years
before. The full cycle of recovery--one recovering addict helping
a newcomer get clean, and that newcomer growing and himself
starting to carry the message--had taken place, all without his
knowledge. Since that moment, I have never doubted that my
service efforts are worthwhile.

    She was one of the first women in Iran NA when she got clean.
     Five years later, the fellowship had grown, but she had drifted
     away from the program. When her husband died, she relapsed.
        Now, clean again, she has true peace and self-respect.

Sacred Places Inside

Iam   one of the first women who found recovery in the NA pro-
gram in Iran.
   I was born to an upper-middle-class family in which everyone
was pretty well educated and successful, but I felt different. I
was afraid of expressing myself since I did not want to be ex-
posed as different or weird. I wanted to be a good daughter and
worked hard to please others, but it seemed like I never could. I
would be successful for a little while, only to lose hope and feel
guilty and powerless to change. I hated myself for most of my
life because of these feelings.
   As I got older, my feelings of discomfort and isolation kept
getting stronger. My inability to belong was the source of some
of my most painful feelings. I couldn't find anyone to feel com-
fortable and close with. I did anything to get attention or approv-
al from others. Sometimes I was loud and active; at other times
I was very quiet. I kept looking for a place to belong. No one in
my family smoked, drank, or used drugs. I started smoking ciga-
rettes when I was sixteen and kept wanting to try new things.
   While I was attending college, I decided to get married to fill
the hole that I felt inside me. In my second year of marriage, my
daughter was born. My feelings of loneliness followed me into
adulthood. I kept looking for new things to fill my emptiness.
Every time I found something new I thought it would fix me.
However, anything that I tried kept my interest only for a short
while and eventually led to more problems and headaches. On
the surface I seemed to have a good, comfortable life, but on the
inside I was ready to explode.

   I found drugs when I was twenty-eight. At the beginning my
husband and I used occasionally for pleasure. As our using pro-
gressed, I felt alarmed and tried to control my using. However,
my disease had become active and gradually spread to different
parts of my life. My compulsion to use grew dramatically. I was
in love with drugs. I used more than people who had been us-
ing for a long time. I believed that I had finally found what I had
always been looking for and didn't know how I could ever live
without drugs. I was in conflict with my using and myself.
   The first few years of using were enjoyable. But after that, all
that was left was pain, isolation, and guilt. I did everything in
secret. I had to deal with the painful reality of my life; the pre-
tending was killing me. After seven or eight years of using, the
only bond left between me and my husband was the drugs. Fi-
nally I came to the conclusion that the only way to free myself
from drugs was to separate from my husband. I was tired and
hated everyone and everything. Today I can see that my whole
life was about self-centeredness. Both my marriage and my sepa-
ration were based in self-centeredness. All of my biggest deci-
sions amounted to running away, escaping reality, and staying
in denial.
   After my separation, I escaped back to drugs. This time I used
until I nearly lost my mind. I felt like a wind-up toy, a sleep-
walker. I reached complete desperation.
   For the last few months of my using, I cried every night. Since
I had tried quitting a few times in the past, only to go back in
very little time, I believed it would take a miracle for me to get
clean. One night I begged God until nearly morning to show
me a way to save myself. The next day I was watching satel-
lite television and saw this person talking about addiction and
getting clean. He was saying unbelievable things about himself
and about recovery. At the end of the program he gave a phone
number in Iran. I called the number many times at all hours, but
no one answered. After a few days, I started losing hope and

370 Narcotics Anonymous


    began to think I was just gullible, and that the show was prob-
    ably a commercial and a bunch of lies. However, I continued call-
    ing the number every few days, until finally one day somebody
    answered--and told me that he didn't have time to talk! But he
    gave me another phone number to call. Full of fear and doubt,
    I called. The person who answered is one of my best friends in
    recovery today.
      I had called looking for some sort of a medication or a simple
    way to quit without having to suffer a lot of pain or taking time
    off from work. I was afraid, so I didn't talk a lot about my using.
    Still, the miracle happened. He told me I needed to get clean and
    go to meetings. When I asked him about a way to detox, he asked
    me if I knew any doctors. My answer was no. Then he shared
    with me that some of us detox without any medication. Even
    though I was using a high dose of drugs, I started from that day.
    For fourteen days I stayed home and went through the pain of
    detoxing. My only connection with the outside world was with
    three people in recovery who called me regularly from Tehran.
      After fifty-one days I went to Tehran and attended a meeting.
    There were no women and only about ten men in that meeting.
    We didn't have a place to meet, so we met in the middle of a park,
    standing even in rain or snow. I didn't know what I was doing
    there, I was afraid, and yet something kept taking me back. Since
    I had no other options, I kept going to meetings and stayed hope-
    ful. I worked the steps and stayed clean for five years. At that
    time I didn't know of any women in recovery in my city, and was
    scared of going to meetings there. Every so often I would go to
    Tehran for a few days to attend meetings. I would go to meetings
    morning, afternoon, and night; and then I would go back home.
    After five years clean I started believing that I could stay clean
    forever. I stayed away from meetings and got separated from
    the program. I got involved with everyday life and forgot why I
    had ever used drugs. I forgot that I had a disease and more im-
    portantly that the disease is progressive and difficult for me to

                                                  Life on Life's Terms 371


detect. I had forgotten that I needed to protect my recovery at all
times, work the steps in my everyday life, attend meetings regu-
larly, and be a part of the program.
  I would only go to my home meetings in Tehran when I had
time or when it was easy for me. By this time in Tehran the meet-
ings had grown and there were many women. I was no longer
alone, but I had become distant and separated. At some point
during this period, I lost my husband whom I dearly loved. His
death was unbearable for me and I relapsed. I still think that if I
had really been committed and involved in the program, maybe
this would not have happened. My relapse didn't last very long;
I only used a few times. But I stopped believing in myself and
returned to complete isolation. I wanted to die.
  During the five years I had been clean, I had built a close rela-
tionship with God. I felt as if God was always with me because
everything was going well, and things were going my way. After
my relapse, I cursed God for a long time. I felt that because I had
stayed clean, He should have protected me from relapse. Ulti-
mately, I had to come back to God and ask for help. One more
time God showed me His miracle. I moved to Tehran where my
home meetings were, but still I would not go to them. I was im-
mersed in hopelessness.
  My original friend in recovery appeared in my life again. With
his help, I went back to meetings, got a sponsor, and started
working the steps. This time I knew that I needed to get more
in-depth with the steps and my recovery. With a new level of
open-mindedness, I gradually got more and more involved in
the program. This time I understood that I couldn't live with-
out NA. I started sponsoring others and getting involved in
service work. The miracle happened for me one more time. My
relapse had become a turning point for me, and within a short
period I grew much more than I had done in the first five years
of recovery. This time, since I have surrendered to the program,
I am learning how to live. Before my relapse I had everything:

372 Narcotics Anonymous


    family, money, love, and a comfortable life. After my husband's
    death and my relapse, when I came back to NA I had lost many
    things, including my husband's love and my financial security.
    Gradually, I have earned much more important things. I have a
    sense of satisfaction about my life. I have peace of mind, faith,
    and a positive outlook on life. I have realized that I have deep,
    sacred places inside, and that events cannot strip them from me.
    My fear has subsided tremendously. I have all of these not just
    because I have stayed clean, but also because I have been will-
    ing to work the steps in my daily life and actions, live the prin-
    ciples of the program, and truly become a member of Narcotics
    Anonymous.
      Because my parents were well known in their community,
    I was always afraid of doing something that would hurt their
    reputation. In my first five years of being clean, I never had the
    courage to attend a large gathering or admit that I was an ad-
    dict in front of others. Today, I go to meetings and conventions,
    and whenever necessary, I let others know that I am an addict. I
    discuss my addiction and my recovery with my parents without
    fear. Today I can be myself and do not have to hide my feelings.
    I am not sorry for my past, and I'm not afraid of tomorrow. I
    don't live with my fears. NA has offered me a life that I never
    expected.
      I believe I needed to experience my relapse in order to take re-
    covery seriously. I realize that relapse is not an easy matter and
    not everyone makes it back. I experienced horrible days and lost
    many things that were important to me. Today I know that I can-
    not stay away from meetings, that I need to move on the path of
    recovery on a daily basis and make steady progress. I realize that
    in order to keep what I have, I need to share it with others. I have
    come to know unconditional love and have more balance in life.
    I experience serenity and know that NA really works.

          Recovery has allowed this inner-city addict to get
     an education and a rewarding career. Through giving back,
          he found that his relationship with his community
               and his God are the keys to real success.


I'm So Grateful
that God Still Hears an Addict's Prayer

My    story is similar to many who have come before me and to
many who will come after me. It is unfortunately typical of far
too many urban, African American men. It includes a childhood
characterized by crime, intravenous drug use, and a disease-
imposed spiritual blackout: As a child I knew God, but during
my active addiction my disease prohibited me from having a
relationship with him.
  Growing up, I was attracted to the people in my community
wholivedthestreetlife.Ilookeduptothemandaspiredtoimitate
them. This was certainly not the attitude of everyone else in my
community. Several of my friends saw these people as nothing
more than "community bloodsuckers," worthy of neither praise
nor respect. I had a sister and a brother with graduate degrees
who served as excellent role models, so it is difficult to explain
why I was drawn to the streets. Maybe it was the loneliness
and emptiness I felt as a child. Or maybe it was my longing for
acceptance, or my need to feel like I "was somebody." Whatever
the case, my obsession with the "streets" would ultimately lead
to years of pain and misery.
  As a child I felt isolated from my family and community and
never really fit in with any particular component of society. I
was always sad and depressed, and pot, to a small degree, freed
me from my isolation, pain, and loneliness. Also, I was a puny
kid who needed others in my life for protection from bullies and
to feel accepted; using provided me protection and acceptance.
I never enjoyed smoking weed. It made me paranoid, caused

                                  373

374 Narcotics Anonymous


    me to act "silly," and gave me the munchies. In spite of these
    unpleasant feelings, I continued, because being accepted by my
    peers was an important value in my life at that time.
       In high school, I experimented with heroin and it instantly
    replaced marijuana as my drug of choice. It seemed to relieve all
    my pain, anguish, and feelings of hopelessness--in the begin-
    ning. It freed me from the need for "protection," because it gave
    me a false sense of toughness and courage. I committed crimes
    in order to support my habit. I would never have had the cour-
    age to do those things before. My addiction led to isolation from
    my family, association solely with other addicts, trouble with the
    law, and a complete disinterest in school. I dropped out of high
    school and traveled the country, trying to "find myself."
       I moved back and forth to Atlanta on three different occasions,
    the final time in 1984. I prayed that this time I would settle down,
    get myself together, and overcome my drug use. However, this
    disease had an agenda of its own. I returned to using drugs daily.
    I shared an apartment with my nephew and a friend. They were
    also addicts, and the three of us used together. One day, after
    nearly overdosing and reaching the point where I became "sick
    and tired of being sick and tired," I dropped to my knees and
    prayed that famous prayer, "Please, God, help me." I'm so grate-
    ful that God still hears an addict's prayer. Shortly thereafter I went
    to my first Narcotics Anonymous meeting. Since that day, God,
    the Twelve Steps, my sponsor, and the fellowship have all worked
    together to help liberate me from a life of active addiction.
       Early in recovery, I learned the value of being involved in the
    fellowship and became active in NA service work, quickly be-
    coming committed to helping others. I held a wide variety of ser-
    vice commitments. From these experiences I gained confidence
    in my abilities to serve.
       My first "real job" was as a counselor. However, because I had
    less than a high school diploma, I was professionally limited. I
    was constantly being told that I did not have the credentials. My

                                                 Life on Life's Terms 375


resentment prevented me from pursuing a degree. I believed that
my life experiences and personal recovery were more valuable.
  Acting on a suggestion from my sponsor, I finally decided to
pursue my education. With this decision came several barriers
and challenges. I had not been in school in almost twenty years,
and I literally did not know where to begin. I dropped out of
high school because school interfered with my mission as a full-
time addict. Early in recovery, through prodding from many of
the "older" members of the fellowship, I earned a GED. But I 28

was thirty-five years old and felt I was too old to be starting a
college career. I figured I would be somewhere in my forties by
the time I graduated. And I had no earthly idea of how I would
attend school and financially support myself. However, I knew
God had not delivered me from active addiction to leave me
stuck in a dead-end job.
  I should have never made it to this point in my life. I should
have been dead and buried, but because of God's grace and
mercy I was blessed with membership in Narcotics Anonymous.
I was able to stay in his good favor because of the direction I re-
ceived from my sponsor, the Twelve Steps of NA, and my friends
in recovery. Each had convinced me that God had positive plans
for me, but I would have to remain obedient and trust him. This
trust could only be exemplified through daily practice of the
principles of NA.
  College was extremely difficult. I had poor study habits (actu-
ally, I had no study habits at all), and I didn't read very well. I
could read the Basic Text and literature from the NA program,
but no other literature held my interest. I was forced to become
active in study groups, and this proved to be an additional chal-
lenge. My cohorts in study groups had no "program," and it was
difficult for me to interact with them. Studying in the library was
hard for me. The silence would literally drive me crazy. Instead
of studying, I would often find myself daydreaming. In spite of
all of these obstacles, through daily prayer and meditation I was

28A high school equivalency degree

    able to graduate with honors and get accepted into the master's
    program at a leading school of social work.
      Graduate school presented a new set of challenges for me. I
    wondered if I was smart enough and suspected my professors
    and the other students believed that I was there not because of
    my abilities but because of affirmative action. I had issues with
    the relatively small number of African American students on
    campus. I did not believe that the white students could identify
    with my experiences. I had similar experiences during the early
    years of my recovery when there were only ten to twelve African
    Americans active in NAin my community. When race was raised
    as an issue, we were quickly reminded that addiction was an
    equal opportunity disease and that it affected us all regardless
    of race. If we were to recover, we needed to discover a strategy
    that would allow us to do so in a manner where the influences of
    race and/or racism would not impede our progress.
      In spite of these challenges, I graduated with a master's degree
    in social work. In one lifetime God has allowed me two chances
    to live, and I am in a position to help others avoid some of the
    painful experiences I suffered through. To me, this is the greatest
    gift I have received. As a member of NA and as a social worker, I
    am charged with the responsibility of helping others.
      I mentioned that during my early days in Atlanta I lived with
    my nephew and a friend. In 1991, my nephew died from com-
    plications of AIDS. Shortly thereafter, my friend was sentenced
    to twenty-five years to life in prison. Today I am celebrating
    more than twenty-one years of NA recovery. I am pursuing a
    PhD in social work. In addition, I serve as executive director of a
    recovery-based nonprofit organization that I founded. None of
    these accomplishments would have been possible without my
    higher power and the Fellowship of NA.
      In the first seventeen years of my recovery I managed to gain
    every material thing a "brother from the 'hood" could dream
    of having, including a four-month internship in South Africa,

                                               Life on Life's Terms 377


where I was blessed with the opportunity to help grow the NA
Fellowship. However, during this period of material gain, I felt
like I lost my soul. I had a "higher power" in my life but I had
no real relationship with him--not the kind of relationship we
discuss in our Eleventh Step.
  One day when I was clean and miserable I was introduced
to other members of NA who spoke openly about their love
for God and a connection between their belief in God and their
recovery from addiction. They talked about spiritual progress
rather than spiritual perfection, and that was important to me
because I never believed I could meet or maintain the standards
that people of faith appeared to live by. Today I don't compare
my NA recovery, faith walk, or love for God with anyone else's.
My relationship with the higher power is real and it's personal.
My agreement with him is that I will do the best I can a day at
a time and he will continue to help me along the way. Under-
standing my responsibility has been the spiritual awakening that
I've discovered through working the Twelve Steps of Narcotics
Anonymous.

      This member from Ireland grew up quiet and withdrawn,
        but recovery helped him overcome his fear of speaking
                in public to find his voice and himself.

Speaking Up

I was  a quiet kid. Being quiet worked for me. When things got
difficult, I found that an impenetrable silence was usually my
best defense. I have a photograph of myself aged about ten,
which shows a very solemn little boy gazing up at the camera.
It reminds me what it was like growing up in the kind of home
where it was often wiser to keep to myself. Even at that age I
constantly sought an escape, and spent much of my childhood
lost in reading.
   The times I pulled my head out of a book long enough to
speak up, my fears were only reinforced. At the age of eleven I
was chosen to do a reading at the service where I'd be confirmed
into the Catholic Church. My family were all there, as well as the
local archbishop. Although I wasn't overburdened with faith, I
knew this was important and really didn't want to mess it up.
When one of the priests came over and asked in a whisper if I
was ready, I immediately launched into the passage. Spoken in a
loud, clear voice, my amplified words echoed around the huge
church. When the reading was finished, I sensed something was
wrong and looked up to find the archbishop staring at me over
his glasses. I felt a sudden stab of shame as I realized I'd been
supposed to wait for him to speak first. It was one of those mo-
ments that seem to go on forever. As they began the ceremony
in earnest I felt very small and very wrong, and I hated it. This
helped instill in me a dread of speaking in public. Later on in life,
I found out that many people were more afraid of public speak-
ing than they were of death. That made a lot of sense to me.
   This phobia was only made worse when my hormones kicked
in and I suddenly found myself the owner of what was, for a

thirteen-year-old, a remarkably deep baritone voice. I was very
self-conscious about the subsonic rumble that came out every
time I opened my mouth and the effect it had on people when
they first heard it. I also started using around this time. All the
reading had paid off--I'd done lots of research into the different
kinds of drugs, and I was already looking forward to working
my way through the menu. I told myself as long as I didn't cross
the line by taking one particular drug, I'd be fine.
  As my teenage years progressed and I got more heavily into
drugs, I found that when I used, it helped me to talk to people.
Of course, when I say people, I really mean girls. When I wasn't
using, I would fall back into a rigid silence. After a while, all I
could talk about with any degree of confidence was drugs.
  In my adult years the only reason I wasn't fired from my job
was that I was self-employed--though it wasn't very helpful
to my professional reputation being regularly searched on the
street by the local drug squad. I could only put so much of my
unmanageable behavior down to my "artistic temperament."
When my family and colleagues tried to find out what was go-
ing on with me, they were met with a stony-faced silence. The
only people who really knew what kind of a life I was leading
were the people I used with. I was experiencing terrible feelings
of inadequacy and self-loathing that even the drugs didn't seem
to be able to mask anymore. I had long since crossed the line I'd
set myself.All I had to look forward to was crossing lines I hadn't
even thought of.
  Then one of my friends started going to NA meetings. Al-
though I desperately wanted to get clean, the idea of spilling my
guts out in front of a roomful of strangers filled me with such
acute anxiety that I resolved to find another way. I tried substi-
tuting drugs, only using when I had a certain combination of
drugs, and started seeing a counselor. Nothing worked--I could
stop using, but I couldn't stop thinking about drugs. It seemed
that the only way to stop thinking about them was to use them.

380 Narcotics Anonymous


    Of course, as soon as I used, the next thought would always be
    "I have to stop doing this."
      Eventually, I couldn't see any other way, so I called my friend
    and she took me to my first meeting. When I got there, I recog-
    nized the people in the room. Some of them I'd met before, from
    school or from using, but in a way I recognized all of them. They
    were like me, and I was like them. In one way they weren't like
    me in that they didn't seem to take themselves as terribly seri-
    ously as I did. In fact, some of them were actually laughing, and
    at themselves. And more significantly, they were talking about
    all the feelings, fears, and insecurities that I had been carrying
    around all my life. I had always thought that I was the only one
    who'd ever had them. It was a very profound experience, and I
    felt at home for the first time in a very long while. This feeling
    was rapidly replaced by mounting horror as I realized that the
    meeting was a round-robin. The sharing was making its way
    around the room toward me. I remember wishing as hard as I
    possibly could that the meeting would finish before they got to
    me. Of course it didn't, so out of politeness I said my name, that
    I was an addict, and that I really didn't like talking about myself.
    That's all I could say at my first NA meeting. Even though I felt
    that I was only calling myself an addict to fit in, when I said the
    words something shifted in me. I didn't know it at the time, but
    I had just started working the First Step.
      Now, I would love to say that as soon as I started to experi-
    ence the love and acceptance that came to me from the people
    in the rooms, it immediately took away my fear of speaking
    publicly. But it didn't. I had to overcome something in me in
    order to be able to share. If anything, once I realized that what
    I needed to talk about was myself, sharing in meetings became
    even more difficult--because I hated not knowing what I was
    talking about.
      Around that time it also became apparent that for me, "shar-
    ing was comparing." I was surrounded by people who seemed

                                                   Life on Life's Terms 381


so much more clever, more articulate, and funnier than me. Ev-
ery time I opened my mouth I struggled to speak through an
avalanche of "not good enough" thoughts. Obviously, a lot of
these thoughts were reflected in what I was sharing. There was
more than a little of "beating myself up" coming from my corner
of the room. It seemed that when I shared, what popped up to
the surface first were all my character defects, to the point that
I sometimes thought that they were all that I had inside me. In
hindsight I can see that this was a pretty useful process, though
it wasn't too comfortable at the time. As well as my voice, my
accent marked me out as someone from a different part of town
from many of the people in the meetings. At first I was tempted
to adjust my accent to fit in better, but even then I could see that
this was just another way of not feeling good enough.
   For the longest time I was unmerciful with myself when I
shared, obsessing about what different people in the room could
be thinking about what I'd said. It took quite a while for me to
realize that many of them were probably just as self-obsessed as
I was. At nearly two years clean I went to a European conven-
tion, and was sharing in my usual low murmur at a marathon
meeting when a brash voice called on me to speak louder. As I
went up a notch in volume (to a quiet murmur), I had the awful
thought that for the last two years maybe no one at home had
heard a word I'd said, but that they'd all been too polite to tell me
and I was going to have to start all over again.
   The thing was that even though on some deep level I felt that
I'd never be any good at sharing, and that I'd never have the ease
that I heard in other members around me, it was vitally impor-
tant that I continue to try. All the times that I opened my mouth
and nothing that seemed to make any sense came out--or even
worse, the many times I just dried up completely--and even
though inside I died a little every time this happened, I knew I
had to keep going, because I needed to share to be a part of NA.
Deep down I knew I needed to be a part of NA if I was going to

    survive. Up until then my way of looking at life had been pretty
    simple: If at first you don't succeed, give up. It was most unusual
    for me to be faced with this constant failure, as I saw it, and nev-
    ertheless to keep going. One thing that really helped was when
    I started to realize that all the criticism was coming from inside
    me, and that what I was getting from the people around me in
    meetings was encouragement and approval.
      After the first few years passed, I even began to let go and ac-
    cept that an easy, expressive way of sharing would always be
    beyond me, but that just because I couldn't share as well as the
    people I admired didn't mean I was any less of a recovering ad-
    dict than they were. I started really working the steps, and one
    of the immediate ways that I could see the benefits was that the
    more I worked them, the easier it became for me to share openly
    and honestly.
      So, as had already been happening in many other areas, the
    miracles started happening in this part of my life. A lot of it had
    to do with practice, which is the only way I've ever become good
    at anything in recovery, including working the steps, sponsor-
    ing members, and doing service. Rather than always seeing it as
    a necessary evil, I started to feel more relaxed about sharing in
    meetings, and actually started to enjoy it occasionally. I was even
    asked by my professional association to chair some of their meet-
    ings, a skill I'd learned through doing service in NA. Then, when
    my grandfather died a few years ago, my family asked me to give
    a eulogy at his funeral--having been the black sheep during my
    using, being asked to be of service like this meant a great deal to
    me. I prepared a short eulogy, adding the words "speak slowly"
    in big, block letters on the top of the page. As I walked up to the
    pulpit I prayed for the ability to do what I needed to do. When
    I got there I took a deep breath and spoke from the heart about
    this man I'd admired so much, and how proud our family was of
    him. When it was over, the congregation applauded and I walked
    back down to sit beside my mother. Her eyes were shining with

                                                   Life on Life's Terms 383


pride, and I felt very grateful to NAfor all the help I'd been given
in rising to the challenge.
  The miracles continue to this day, and show no signs of letting
up. Last year, long after I'd given up on ever being asked, I was
the main speaker at our regional convention. As the moment of
truth approached, my nerves were jangling. An oldtimer at my
table leaned over and said quietly, "Just be yourself." I took his
advice, and to my surprise and delight I actually enjoyed speak-
ing in front of pretty much all of the local fellowship. As I neared
the end of my share, there was polite applause when I mentioned
that I've done everything right in recovery. This was followed
by laughter when I pointed out that I've also done everything
wrong. And when I pointed out that the greatest mistake I've
ever made in recovery was thinking that I wasn't good enough, I
could feel the waves of identification from the members washing
over me with their applause.
  I am very grateful to Narcotics Anonymous for so many
things, not least for the ability to survive long enough to truly get
to know and value myself. There have been many awakenings
and miracles along the way, and one of the most important for
me was that through the meetings and program of NA, I have
found my voice. And through finding my voice, I have found
myself.

      This Portuguese addict was planning to abandon his young
      daughter and go buy drugs when a group of NA members
    invited him to a meeting. Now his daughter is grown and sees
      what NA has taught him about intimacy, respect, and love.

NA Is a Road Map

My    friends say that I am protected by God. My story should
have ended in a jail, mental institution, or cemetery. I have been
to the first two, and I have seen my younger sister and many of
my friends die from overdoses. But I have been in recovery for
almost seventeen years and, due to a strange coincidence, I was
born in 1953, the same year Narcotics Anonymous was born to
the world. Maybe my friends are right.
  I was born in Lisbon, the only male in a family of six women--
my grandmother, my mother, and four sisters. I felt protected by
my family and my neighborhood; life seemed to be about either
demanding things to happen or using my strength to get things
done. When I left the protection of my neighborhood to enter
secondary school I was scared. Anger became my best defense
and, at the age of fourteen, I found drugs. They became my best
allies.
  In 1974 I ran away to Holland to avoid arrest. A few months
later, the Portuguese dictatorship was overthrown. The revolu-
tion made it possible for me to return home. During that time of
anarchy and confusion I found pride and security dealing drugs
with a gang. If you close your eyes and imagine everything an ad-
dict can do to feed his obsession, you can be sure I did all that.
  Narcotics Anonymous found me in a mental institution at the
age of thirty-six, during one of the many detoxes I had under-
gone in twenty-two years of active addiction. A group of addicts
decided not to go to the beach in the heat of the Lisbon summer,
and instead carried the NA message into an institution. When I
left that institution I went with a friend to my first NA meeting.

After my third meeting I decided that Narcotics Anonymous
groups were a good place to deal drugs safely, because every-
body said they had the desire to use, they seemed to have money,
and they spoke about confidentiality. At my fifth meeting they
explained that the rooms were not a place to sell drugs; they
were a place to learn to live without them. I decided NA was not
for me, and left.
   I had spent more than half of my life using; I was sick and
tired and could not live with or without drugs. I wanted to stop
using but did not know how. At that time I didn't know I had a
disease; all I knew was that I could not stay a minute without us-
ing. When I couldn't sleep I would hurt myself so that physical
pain would distract me from the distress I felt inside. I continued
using for another year.
   In June 1990 I decided to camp with my seven-year-old
daughter in an isolated part of southern Portugal. I thought that
because I loved her, I would be able to not use. But each night I
left my child alone in the tent and drove as much as 600 km in
order to use "just one more time." Soon I had no more money.
                                    29

My daughter cried for food. I went to a restaurant and asked for
food for her and wine for me. I had a plan: While my daughter
ate I would steal a car and drive to Lisbon. With the sale of the
car I could use again. I convinced myself that because she could
say her mother's phone number, she would be safe.
   When I walked through the door I heard people laughing. In-
sane as I was, I believed they were laughing at me. I headed for
their table to beat them and make them stop. When I approached
the group, I recognized them and they recognized me: They were
NA members who went to that meeting where I had arrived a
year earlier. Like a miracle, my anger was gone and they invited
my daughter and me to sit with them. They paid for our dinner,
listened to my complaints, and told me that I needed a meeting. I
tried to convince them that I needed money to buy drugs. Finally
I agreed to a meeting, hoping I would make them change their

386 Narcotics Anonymous


    minds. They got a Basic Text from the car, and we had a meeting
    in the woods by the road. During that meeting--which today I
    consider my first--I cried my soul out. I cried for all the years of
    anguish and desperation.
      They put gas in my car, and I went home with the promise that
    I would go back to meetings. I went, even though I couldn't stop
    using. With the help of a friend in NA, I was institutionalized,
    and have not used since. My first year in recovery was fabulous!
    Learning to taste the basic pleasures of life and the simple fact
    of being clean--to be able to sleep, to eat, to bathe, and not have
    diarrhea--was more than enough. The meetings were an en-
    chantment: the laughing, the sharing, the shame of my first
    dance in recovery, the friendships, the availability of other mem-
    bers, service meetings, the "fights" for a service position, the
    enthusiasm to carry the message to the still-using addict--every-
    thing was a wonder.
      During my second year in recovery my sponsor was diag-
    nosed with cancer, and I moved in to take care of him. I admired
    his recovery, and he was the one who helped me believe I was
    capable of staying clean. He didn't want to take painkillers even
    though his pain was enormous. I was confused; it seemed un-
    reasonable to endure such suffering. I was frightened, insecure,
    and tired. I worked during the day and took care of him at night.
    Because I did not leave him alone, I no longer went to meetings.
    I needed my sponsor, but he was ill and needed me. One sleep-
    less night, I considered killing him. The strength of that thought
    scared me: I no longer used drugs, but anger still lived in me
    and manifested itself every time I was invaded by fear. I started
    to see myself again as a bad person, without principles, capable
    of doing terrible things.
      Finally he was hospitalized. I was alone and scared and began
    to have one relationship after another. I didn't want to use again,
    but I needed something to take away the anguish. I started a vi-
    cious cycle: The more I avoided drugs by using people, the more

                                                  Life on Life's Terms 387


shame and resentment I felt. Service became a tool to impose my
will on others. I fought with a member in front of the group, and
people started to criticize me. I was avoiding meetings.
  When I was offered a job outside of Lisbon, I did not think
twice. I ran away. I didn't go to meetings--the closest one was
250 km away --and did not speak to my sponsor. I got in-
                30

volved in another relationship, but I didn't even know how to
live with myself. When she left me for someone else, I felt lost
and meaningless.
  Afew days later my sponsor called to ask how I was doing. We
spoke for hours, and I told him that NA didn't work for me. He
asked, "How can you say that if you did not give the program
a chance? How about giving yourself a chance, too? Why don't
you start working the steps?" Those simple questions flashed
like a lightning bolt!
  I started to work steps with my sponsor, who helped me to
realize the depth of my disease. When I was six years old, I had
been paralyzed with rheumatic fever. My healing took a long
time, and I couldn't run or play. I felt different from the other
boys; I felt crippled, and couldn't understand the difference be-
tween limitations and deficiency. Remembering that I quit the
treatment for that disease as soon as I could, and the obsessive
way I started to compete with others to be the best, no matter
what, helped me to understand the power of my denial.
  When I started working Step Two, I needed to trust something
outside of me; I needed to be with other addicts. I accepted an
opportunity to work with addicts professionally. At the same
time a friend and I started an NA meeting. At the beginning
there were just the two of us, but little by little the newcomers
arrived. We did hospitals and institutions service work at a jail.
Aday at a time, a meeting at a time, we grew. We formed an area
and organized our first convention. I felt alive again and had an
objective in life.

      But I started to have problems with my boss, who wanted
    to stop me from going to NA meetings. I refused. Twice I had
    turned my back on Narcotics Anonymous and my life had be-
    come a nightmare. I would not make that same mistake again.
    I was fired and returned to Lisbon. I felt insecure and afraid of
    what people might think of me. But this time things were dif-
    ferent: I had Narcotics Anonymous in my life and the desire to
    change. I found that the Twelve Steps of NA are a road map that
    show me the best direction to get to my destination: to view oth-
    ers with respect and consideration, to learn to value myself and
    accept life on its own terms, and to stop living based on fantasy--
    to abandon the idea that I am the center of the universe.
      In Lisbon I kept doing service work and going to meetings reg-
    ularly. I was welcomed in the rooms with open arms, and if there
    were critical voices, they did not touch my heart. I found a group
    where I felt comfortable, and it is still my home group. My life
    became a constant exercise in awakening and learning. I learned
    to forgive myself and to take responsibility for my change and
    growth. The spirituality NA talks about is for me the quality of
    the relationship I build with myself, with Life (God as I under-
    stand Him), and with others. Working the spiritual principles of
    this program with the help of Steps Five, Six, and Seven is the
    vehicle that helps me travel this path.
      When I had nine years clean two things happened: My spon-
    sor relapsed, and my daughter, who was then sixteen, came to
    live with me. The loss of my sponsor and the happiness of hav-
    ing my daughter with me were contradictory emotions that I
    lived simultaneously. I came to realize that life is a constant sum
    of good and bad moments, and the only thing I can control is my
    attitude. The traces of my character will never leave me, but I can
    learn healthy management of them.
      Living with my daughter has helped me learn to share my
    space and to accept others as they are. Involvement in service
    has helped me too--to accept that other people's ideas are as

important as my own. NA is not a place for "me" and "others,"
but rather for "us." My faith in Narcotics Anonymous was re-
freshed by the hard work and dedication of our work together
for the evolution of NA. For me it was a spiritual awakening
to realize that in spite of our differences, our common purpose
is the same, and is what actually binds us together. For many
years my perception of fellowship was only a bit wider than
my country's boundaries. The opportunity to live the reality of
a Universal NA is a great spiritual experience that is difficult to
put in words. I owe my life to NA because it did not let me die
from drugs, but also because I was reborn as a human being.
   On my daughter's twentieth birthday, my father died. Once
again life was offering me good and bad, happiness and grief,
death and life, side by side. I had the chance to be with my father
in his last hours of life, to be friends with him again after being
separated from him by my addiction. Our eyes met and we were
able to say good-bye without having to use words. That same day
we celebrated life, my daughter's birthday, at a family dinner.
   Today I feel like a different man, capable of respecting my
family. I am a proud father and a happy man. I am privileged: I
like my profession, and I enjoy the material goods I've been able
to acquire. More important, my family and friends love me and
respect me. My fellow NA members help me to be conscious
that I have a disease that never rests, and that only through the
NarcoticsAnonymous program can I learn to keep it from taking
over my life again.
   For three years I was unable to establish a relationship with an-
other sponsor. I was one of the members with the most clean time
in my country who still went to meetings and did regular service
work. I tried sponsorship at a distance, but that didn't work. For
me intimacy is still very difficult, and distance and lack of person-
al contact make that task even more difficult. During those years
the rooms, service, and my sponsees were my support system. A
year ago I started a new sponsorship relationship--it isn't easy,

    but I won't give up because I want to keep on working the steps
    and growing as a person.
       Recently, at another birthday dinner for my daughter, I man-
    aged to ask her a question I had had in mind for some years:
    What kind of father had I been? She answered: "You taught me
    values, principles, and to live with dignity." My heart almost
    burst with love and gratitude. I can only give what I have, and
    if I gave her all this it is because I first received it from you, the
    Fellowship of Narcotics Anonymous.

    His recovery journey brought him from a job as a pharmacist to
    one working alongside recovering addicts and has given him the
     tools to deal with life's challenges--illness, grief, and intimacy.

The Gratitude
Side of Circumstance

I  was most afraid for my recovery when I had twelve years
clean, and this intense fear lasted for the next four years of my
personal journey.
   A series of deaths in my network of loved people happened in
close succession: my brother, my mother, my father, and a close
friend who I helped into recovery. It felt like twenty-four-hour-
a-day grieving on a forever basis. In the middle of trying to cope
withtheselosses,Icontractedalife-threateninginfectionandspent
ninety days in the hospital, able to move my limbs only with great
effort. I didn't leave the bed for sixty continuous days.Abreathing
machine inhaled and exhaled for me in a loud, pounding rhythm
for five weeks, and I had a frightening leg wound open to the bone
that had to be cleaned and dressed every few hours. It all seemed
too much at once. I lay there, feeling no courage, no faith, and no
hope for anything good to happen ever again. I kept thinking that
if I wasn't hospitalized, I probably couldn't have stayed clean. Be-
ing captive gave me no choice, in a sense.
   I spent the next couple of years gradually learning to walk and
work and function again. It was all-consuming, requiring every-
thing I had and everything that others gave me: support, love,
time, and tears. Encouragement came from other NA members,
from my sponsor and his wife, and from my own devoted wife
and three sons.
   These were the straightforward challenges, the unavoid-
able challenges. I call them "no-choice challenges." I had to do
whatever I could to gain some degree of function and comfort.
There were other challenges, though. Chief among them was the

                                     391

392 Narcotics Anonymous


    question of how I could find what I needed in the Twelve Steps
    of NA, the NA meetings, and the support offered by friends. It
    wasn't obvious to me at all.
      My sponsor, along with his wife, was my inspiration in over-
    coming these. They shared with me about living with limita-
    tions, living with medical problems, and just about daily living.
    We talked of this additional second chance, how it was a new
    opportunity to live when I might well be dead, and how it was
    so much like getting clean in the first place. We talked about the
    obligation we all had--that is, to carry the message to others in
    order to stay in recovery ourselves. All I could think of was how
    hard that was to do when I was consumed with wishing that
    something was different. I looked for some opportunity to find
    gratitude for my life and to surrender being obsessed with my
    own troubles. How could I carry any message of recovery unless
    I could get to the gratitude side of my circumstances? This was
    the impetus for my path from then until now. Every day I try
    to allow myself to be absorbed with self for a definite period of
    time, a little longer on a bad day, and then I turn to a more posi-
    tive perspective.
      Reviewing Steps One to Three every single day means that I
    go through the process of acknowledging how powerless I am,
    confirming my belief that a Higher Power is there to help me,
    and surrendering my self-will. This takes me to the place of
    gratitude and hope and helpfulness so that I can work on the re-
    maining nine steps. That's what I do each day and how I stay in
    recovery today. It's the foundation of my program.
      I remember when I started using just like it was yesterday. I
    had been sidelined with a chronic intestinal illness on and off
    for years, and I struggled each time with staying on painkill-
    ers and going off the medication. For twelve continuous years,
    I had been hospitalized for many weeks each year and tried to
    stay off painkilling medication, with little success. After a very
    painful series of events, my only daughter became seriously ill.

She died immobilized in a hospital room after extensive surgery
and prolonged suffering. I had carried her into surgery, and that
last image of the real her has never left me. I distinctly remember
making a conscious decision at that very moment that I would
do whatever it took in order to never feel that way again. I came
pretty close to achieving that goal for a short time, but soon
found that I had an unexpected problem: I couldn't stop using
drugs, even when I wanted to. Before long, I lost all hope and
was convinced that I would die using, and soon.
   After being treated for an infection from a dirty needle and be-
ing ostracized from my job and family, I came to NA in Boulder,
Colorado, at the age of thirty-five, in January 1981. I'd wound up
in a local treatment center where every day was filled with opi-
ate withdrawal symptoms, unprovoked crying, and a constant
craving for narcotics. They gave me a tape of a recovering ad-
dict talking about staying clean and told me I had to go to both
NA meetings in our town. I did that and was not surprised that
I didn't find any other health professionals there. However, I did
find other addicts there, and some had track marks on their arms
just like me, so I felt okay about being there. One thing was cer-
tain: I didn't know how to be at home without using. The addicts
at the meeting shared with great passion about the despair of not
being able to stop using drugs, how they had alienated everyone
close to them, how they'd lost all hope and didn't know how to
stay clean until they came to NA. It soon became obvious to me
that I felt much better at NA meetings than I felt anywhere else,
and so I went to NA meetings as often as possible.
   The other addicts in my NAmeeting told me that I might have
to think about giving up my profession in order to stay clean. It
made sense to me because, once I stopped using for a few weeks,
I was terrified of going back to being a pharmacist and being
around all the medication. I couldn't imagine working around
narcotics and syringes without eventually self-medicating. After
choosing not to use drugs that day, my first significant surrender

394 Narcotics Anonymous


    to recovery was to give up my total investment in my profession
    and my identity as a pharmacist because I wanted to stay clean
    more than anything else in life.
      So I followed the path of the thousands of addicts who came
    before me. I went to meetings, read literature, asked my sponsor
    to help me find ways to make the steps meaningful to me, and
    got involved in our new local NA fellowship. After I was clean
    about two years, we started a regional committee and a phone-
    line. The other addicts told me what to do and I did my best to do
    what they said. NA meetings grew in our state from two meet-
    ings to over 100 as a result of the NA phoneline. It was my first
    experience with NAservice and trying to do something good for
    another addict. At that point I didn't even know that I absolutely
    had to do it to stay clean; I just wanted to do it because I wanted
    other addicts to find what I was finding. Later, I noticed the parts
    of our literature that told how we must "give it away to keep it,"
    and I related to that for the first time.
      I enrolled in school in hopes of finding a new way to earn a liv-
    ing. While there, and with five years clean, I applied for a job that
    involved working with other NA members. I went to work and
    stayed there for eighteen years, working in situations that gave
    me the privilege of interacting with many elements of Narcot-
    ics Anonymous all over the world. This work situation quickly
    became both a gift and a curse. It was rewarding and special to
    work in that capacity, but to my surprise, it was emotionally and
    spiritually draining and often challenged my personal recovery
    in ways that I never imagined. I was with many strong person-
    alities all the time. I had to learn to question my motivation con-
    stantly in my work; was I really working to help others, or was I
    just trying to accomplish what I thought should happen?
      My sponsor was a great help to me by teaching me some
    simple guidelines to use every single day--for example, figure
    out exactly what my responsibilities are and do my very best to
    accomplish them, but do not get involved in peripheral issues or

                                                  Life on Life's Terms 395


service politics. He also taught me that my job could not be my
recovery under any circumstances. I had to maintain my recov-
ery outside of work and after hours, or else I couldn't be success-
ful at my job and maintain my personal integrity.
  Some of the most significant things I've learned in my recovery
have been in the area of family. Today I am still with the woman
I was with while using. In fact, I've had three relationships with
this same woman: before using, while using, and in recovery.
Each period has been distinct in so many ways. My own levels
of commitment and honesty have differed in each phase in some
obvious ways, but also in some very profound and perhaps less
obvious ways that my step work helped me to address. I learned,
after too many years of recovery, that just because something
pops into my head, I don't need to say it to my spouse in the
way I'm thinking it. Sometimes it's best if I don't say it at all, and
I actually can turn and leave the room rather than say something
hurtful. Further, I have a responsibility to honor this very spe-
cial woman and to communicate to her with honesty but also
with great sensitivity. It isn't only about me any longer. I can and
should give to her in the same ways that I give to addicts; in fact,
I have an obligation to give 100 percent of my best self to her and
to my three sons. It's a goal that I work toward every day, and my
relationship with all of them is better for this effort.
  There's one vivid memory from before I ever came to recovery
that stays in my mind always. It happened even before I started
using, while I was practicing pharmacy at a local drugstore in
my community. I was very committed to public health and al-
ways took the opportunity to "bust" addicts when they brought
in phony prescriptions for drugs. I was convinced that I was do-
ing a good thing for them and for the community. One night an
addict came in with a prescription for a narcotic, and it was ob-
viously forged. When I called the police and an officer came, the
addict broke down crying and sobbing. "Please kill me now, just
shoot me now," he kept pleading. His passion was genuine and

396 Narcotics Anonymous


    touched us all. Soon we--the addict, the policeman, and I--were
    all crying for him because it was obvious that he would rather
    die than not be able to get what he needed. I didn't fully under-
    stand it then and for a long time afterward. Today I understand
    it from deep inside my soul, because I've felt the same thing and
    with the same passion. This is one of many reasons that I am
    dedicated to helping other addicts. Maybe someday I can even
    help that very addict, the one who came in the drugstore that
    night, to find recovery in Narcotics Anonymous.
       While each new day is the most important one in my recov-
    ery, I have found great value in staying clean for an extended
    period. I came to recovery at age thirty-five; now, at the time of
    this writing, I am in my early sixties. Many difficult things have
    happened in my life over those years, but my recovery program
    has allowed me to meet the challenges without causing hurt and
    damage in most cases. Loss of loved ones, physical and emo-
    tional setbacks, and other hardships are certain to be part of our
    lives as we grow older, and I am so very grateful that I've been
    in recovery for most of them in my life so far. I've learned, with
    a lot of help, to practice spiritual principles in my affairs and to
    find some inner peace.
       Even though the person I used to be is still inside me in many
    ways, I'm no longer known for being him; my identity is much
    more about who I am and how I live my life now. My recovery is
    my first priority, even after all these years. I do what's required
    to live with my physical limitations and problems, and I get the
    strength to do that from working one-to-one with other addicts.
    I have a definite message to give: An educated professional with
    a life-altering illness can stay clean in NarcoticsAnonymous if he
    helps others do the same and continues to ask for help.
       Others have characterized the message of my story in much
    fewer words than I've used here--the story of how a regular guy
    can be consumed by addiction and find recovery from it in Nar-
    cotics Anonymous. It's simple and it's my door to freedom from
    active addiction. I like that.
